Hi, How are you? My name is Chat Doctor.  I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I will attempt to answer your question. Cholelithiasis or gall bladder stones is a very common finding in scans of the abdomen. 10% to 20% of population will develop stones at some time in their lifetime. Up to 80% of these patients will never experience biliary pain or complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis.  Hence, most gallstones are clinically "silent," and is an incidental finding often uncovered during abdominal ultrasound being performed for another reason. People with such asymptomatic cholelithiasis, however, eventually may develop symptoms (biliary pain) that require treatment, but this risk is quite low. An even lower proportion (1-2%) may develop major gallstone complications. Therefore, expectant management is an appropriate choice for silent gallstones in the general population. The exception is patients at high risk for experiencing biliary complications - Large gallstones (>3 cm) or gallbladders crammed with stones that carry a higher risk of developing gallbladder cancer. So in your case if you are currently not suffering from any symptoms and all you have is a small stone in the GB, I would advise a "wait and watch" policy. If in future you do develop symptoms like pain, fever, omitting, dyspepsia, etc. then I would get operated on. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a fairly simple and routine surgery done in most surgical centers. Unfortunately once the stones have been formed, there are no medications which will help in treating them. Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better soon. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further clarifications. Have a great day

HI, I understand your concern. Smoking in pregnancy is hazardous to both mother & child.  Smoking in first 3 months increases chances of fetal abnormalities, specially heart problem.  Smoking in early months of pregnancy carries risk of placental complications, abortion, premature deliver, low birth weight, future obesity, future smoking addiction.  Mother also is exposed to pregnancy induced hypertension after smoking in pregnancy followed by further complications like toxemia of pregnancy.  * Its good that you have totally quit smoking at present. You need not start it again to satisfy uncontrollable urge to do so. Trey self-control/ counseling/ chewing clove/ beetle nut as an alternative. DO NOT start smoking again.  - AS you had smoked in early months, it's better to assess babies status as far congenital defects with investigations like 3D USG scan & follow doctors advise as far as its management is concerned.  Thanks.
Based on your symptoms, I suspect that you have dislocated your patella, which is also known as your kneecap.

You can apply medium potency steroid cream application such as mometasone or fluticasone cream. You can take antihistamine Ben Chat Doctor. Take care.
Hello Chat Doctor. First step is to take the clothes off of the child. Let him with one layer or naked if possible. You could use again eugenic 200 mg every 6-8 hours, 3 doses in 24 hours and between the medicine you could make your child a bath with warm water. Not with cold water as it will make the temp rise. When bathing with warm water take out a cup with warm water and put in a cup with cold water. So cool it down gradually. If fever persists more than 3 days with full 24 hours send him to the hospital it could be bacterial. Check him up and possibly do a Urinalysis.

Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of chronic inflammation of the spine and the sacroiliac joints. Chronic inflammation in these areas causes pain and stiffness in and around the spine. The treatment of ankylosing spondylitis typically involves the use of medications to reduce inflammation and/or suppress immunity to stop progression of the disease, physical therapy, and exercise. Nucoxia contains etoricoxib which is used to relieve pain and inflammation. The prognosis for patients with ankylosing spondylitis is very much dependent upon the location and severity of its manifestations. The prognosis is best for those who maintain close monitoring with the treating doctors and who incorporate physical activities designed to maintain mobility.  If he is smoking its better quit smoking. Oral or injectable corticosteroids (cortisone) are potent anti-inflammatory agents and can effectively control spondylitis and other inflammations in the body, but can't be used for longer time. I advise him to follow the doctors advice, and he can lead near normal life. Regards
Hi there, A lump in your neck during an ear infection is most commonly an enlarged lymph node. A number of things can cause lymph nodes to become enlarged, but in the vast majority of the time, the cause is an infection. Other causes can be malignancy, but this is much rarer. If the lymph node is tender, it makes malignancy much more unlikely. I'd take ibuprofen and use warm compresses on the affected area. If the lymph node gets smaller, I wouldn't worry about it at all. If it continues to be enlarged, hardened and painless, then I would seek out an ultrasound. Again, I'd give it a week after your other symptoms resolve before I'd start to worry. I hope this answers your question. Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.

Hi, Do not here this nonsense tip given by this type of person. If this is the case then every married man should have lost energy and handicapped ! Masturbation does not have any side effect either less of energy or muscle weakness or not having any bed effect in sex life. This is just like other feelings like thirst, hunger, joy etc. At young age this is common habit where male hormone is its maximum level. So there is no harm doing masturbation. I always advice that keep this habit in control as excess in every thing should be avoided. If one person does not do masturbation, excess amount of semen is going into blood stream, metabolized in the body and will be thrown by kidneys. Ok and take care.

Hello, I went through your query. If more than 75% of tooth structure is lost then placing a crown (cap) on the broken tooth is not recommended. Otherwise, there is a possibility of placing a Post and Core on the tooth. That has to be decided by your dentist based on the condition of the tooth. Also, I would not recommend leave the broken tooth without a crown. And between dental implants and bridge, I would recommend a Dental implant, if the condition of the bone is sound, because it does not involve preparation (cutting) of the adjacent teeth. Hope you are benefited by the answer.

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, this does not carry good prognosis in your mothers case. She is having low heart pumping (25%) and chronic kidney disease (dialysis dependent). So her heart and kidneys are almost non-functioning. When these two organs fail in their work, fluid tend to accumulate in the body. This is the reason why she is having fluid in the lungs. This also causes breathlessness. So breathlessness and fluid in the lungs suggest further deterioration in heart and kidney functions. And hence this carries poor prognosis. Chances of getting better are very, very less. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.

Hello Mr. Mukesh, You said you take alcohol daily and your LFT showed mild increase in Bilirubin levels and liver enzyme levels. It indicates that your liver had some injury due to your alcohol intake. The serum bilirubin levels and liver enzymes levels will revert to normal in few days. But taking alcohol in future may again cause elevation of bilirubin and liver enzymes. Daily alcohol intake may cause Cirrhosis of liver with Portal Hypertension due to which you will have permanent liver failure and it's dangerous to life. About the food, yeah you can take spicy food if you don't have any Gastritis problem. But if you develop Cirrhosis and portal hypertension, you need to take low salt and less spicy food. My advice is to stop taking alcohol and be on follow up with your physician.

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You had chronic mold exposure. This can lead to bronchitis (inflammation of airways). Bronchitis causes bronchospasm and this in turn causes cough, expectoration, chest tightness, breathing difficulty etc. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hello. Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor You seem to have an Chat Doctor.  One month of time is too short for any significant improvement. The increase in hair fall too is not much of a worry once you understand the reason for it.

Brief... if high bilirubin level is physiological then phototherapy or blood exchange (transfusion) is the best treatment. Detailed answer. There can be many causes of high bilirubin level, which are treated accordingly. For example.if there is jaundice within first 24 hrs of birth, it is almost always pathological like because of AGO incompatibility; hereditary He diseases or hereditary biliary sclerosis etc. If jaundice is after 24 hrs of birth, it can be because of breast milk or physiological as liver enzymes are not mature enough to metabolize etc. Well first from the history of your child, it seems that she has been suffering from physiological (normal) jaundice, which can be treated with phototherapy and exchange transfusion. But if bilirubin level is above 20 it can effect brain so the sensory hearing loss and which can be permanent and non-treatable, so better to be on safe side, hearing test should be done, once child is stable.

Hello, Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. Firstly, ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile phase in the cycle when an unprotected intercourse can cause pregnancy. Around the menstrual period, it is safe to have intercourse without risk of pregnancy. The medication is not of much use as an emergency contraception. You have to use a proper pill or go for the insertion of an IUD as an emergency contraceptive. This should be done as soon as possible to prevent failure. Hope this helps.

Hi, This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to Chat Doctor.  Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually, I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is -1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Hope I have answered your query.

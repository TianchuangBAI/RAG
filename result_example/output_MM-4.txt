Hi, I understand your concern. The symptoms you describe can be caused by many different conditions, so it is difficult to make a specific diagnosis without seeing the bumps. You have not mentioned whether you have any pain, itching, burning, or discharge from the bumps.

If you do not have any of these symptoms, it is also important to see a doctor, but you can be reassured that these bumps are not a sign of a serious medical condition. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

If you have been diagnosed with DVT, it is important to continue taking your medication as prescribed by your doctor. This will help to prevent further complications.

Hello, I am sorry for the loss of your father.  The findings you have described are consistent with chronic hepatitis.  Chronic hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that can occur for many different reasons, most commonly from a virus.  There are a number of viruses that can cause hepatitis, but you have already had testing for hepatitis A, B, C, and E and these are all negative.  The other viruses that can cause hepatitis are usually not tested for because they are very rare.  It is possible that your father has hepatitis from another cause, such as medications, alcohol, or a condition that affects the liver.  I recommend that you ask his doctor if he is taking any medications that can cause hepatitis.  If he is not, then he should be evaluated for a condition that affects the liver.  There are a number of conditions that can affect the liver and cause hepatitis, such as autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and Wilson's disease.  I recommend that he see a hepatologist to evaluate him for these conditions.  I hope this helps.  Take care.
Thanks for your question! We're here to help with health information. It sounds like you're experiencing chest pain. Chest pain can be very serious, so it's important that you seek medical attention as soon as possible. I would recommend that you go to the emergency room and get an electrocardiogram done. This will show whether or not you are having a heart attack or other cardiac issues. If there are no signs of heart attack then I would recommend that you see a cardiologist for further evaluation. You may need an angiogram done which is an invasive procedure where a catheter is inserted into your artery and then injected with dye so that we can see what's going on inside your arteries. This is a very common procedure and it's very safe. I hope this helps! Let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.

Hello, I am sorry to hear about your mother's condition. As you have rightly mentioned, heart failure and dialysis are both very serious conditions. The heart and the kidneys are both vital organs, and they work together to maintain normal body functions. Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump blood efficiently to meet the body's needs. Dialysis is the process of filtering and purifying the blood using a machine. It is done when the kidneys are not functioning properly. Your mother's heart is functioning at 25%, which is very low. Her chances of getting better will depend on the cause of her heart failure and the severity of the kidney disease. If her heart failure is due to a reversible cause, such as a heart attack or valve disease, then her chances of getting better are good. If the cause is irreversible, such as severe coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy, then her chances of getting better are poor. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Hi, Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that involves scarring of the lung tissue. It is also called interstitial lung disease (ILD). As the disease progresses, the lungs become scarred and thickened, which may lead to a variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath. Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic condition that causes the scarring of lung tissue, making it hard to breathe. The lungs are made up of alveoli, which are tiny air sacs that allow oxygen to enter the bloodstream. When the alveoli become damaged, they are replaced with fibrous tissue. This causes the lungs to become stiff and less able to expand. Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic condition, and it cannot be cured. The goal of treatment is to slow the progression of the disease and relieve symptoms. Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic condition, and it cannot be cured.

Thanks for your question! I will help you with it. I think you do need to consider emergency contraception. If the condom was broken, there is a chance that your boyfriend ejaculated inside you.

I would recommend that you take emergency contraception to help prevent pregnancy. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
Hello, and thank you for using our services. I understand your concern. In my opinion the most probable cause of the increase in creatinine is an acute renal injury. This may be due to a urinary tract infection, a urinary stone, or a kidney injury. I would recommend you to consult with your Nephrologist to do a renal ultrasound and a urine culture to rule out these causes. If no cause is found, then you should do a renal biopsy. I hope you find this answer helpful. Best wishes.
Hi, Bleeding can occur in cirrhosis of the liver due to portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Portal hypertension causes increased pressure in the veins that supply blood to the liver. This can lead to the formation of varices, which are dilated veins that can rupture and cause bleeding. This bleeding can manifest as bloody stools or vomiting blood. The MRI and ultrasound are not likely to be the cause of the bleeding. I would recommend that you take him to the hospital immediately for further evaluation and treatment. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.

Hi, I am sorry to hear that you have a problem with black shade on your cheeks. I think the best way to treat this problem is to see a dermatologist for a complete examination and treatment. If the black shade is due to a fungal infection, the best treatment is to use a topical antifungal cream like clotrimazole or ketoconazole. If the black shade is due to a bacterial infection, the best treatment is to use a topical antibiotic cream like mupirocin or clindamycin. If the black shade is due to a skin condition like eczema, the best treatment is to use a topical steroid cream like mometasone or fluticasone. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions.

Hi, I understand that you are worried about the sonography and the GTT test. Let me explain each of them in detail. In the sonography, the doctor says that the amniotic fluid is more. The amniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds the baby in the womb. It is important to know the amount of the amniotic fluid in the womb as too much of it is a sign of diabetes. Also, if the baby is not moving enough, the amniotic fluid may increase. However, I would like to know if your doctor said that the amniotic fluid is more, but the other body parts of the fetus are normal. If the amniotic fluid is more, it is an indication of diabetes, but the other body parts of the fetus are normal, then the baby may be fine. The doctor may have done a stomach bubble sonography to see if the stomach of the fetus is swollen. If the stomach is swollen, it is a sign of diabetes. The doctor may have also done a test for the urine of the fetus to see if there is any sugar in the urine. If the urine of the fetus is normal, then the baby may be fine. The doctor may have also done a test for the blood of the fetus to see if the sugar level is high. If the sugar level of the fetus is high, then the baby may be fine. The doctor may have also done a test for the blood of the mother to see if the sugar level is high. If the sugar level of the mother is high, then the baby may be fine. If the sugar level of the mother is high, then the baby may be fine. The doctor may have also done a test for the urine of the mother to see if there is any sugar in the urine. If the urine of the mother is normal, then the baby may be fine. The doctor may have also done a test for the blood of the mother to see if the sugar level is high. If the sugar level of the mother is high, then the baby may be fine. The doctor may have also done a test for the urine of the mother to see if there is any sugar in the urine. If the urine of the mother is normal, then the baby may be fine. The doctor may have also done a test for the blood of the mother to see if the sugar level is high. If the sugar level of the mother is high, then the baby may be fine. The doctor may have also done a test for the urine of the mother to see if there is any sugar in the urine.

Hello, Thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Your SGPT and SGOT are high, indicating liver injury. Since you are a heavy alcohol user, the most likely cause of your elevated liver enzymes is alcohol induced liver injury. Your bilirubin is also high, indicating some degree of jaundice. You should stop alcohol immediately. Your liver enzymes will decrease in about 1-2 months. I hope my answer was helpful.
Hi there. I understand your concerns. But I am unable to help you with this query as it is unrelated to the ES. The information you have provided is insufficient to provide you with an appropriate answer. Please consult your doctor for a detailed examination and treatment. I hope this helps.
Hi there. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I am sorry to hear about your health problems. Let me try to help you. Based on the ultrasound report, I think you have a mild liver enlargement. This is usually seen in people with fatty liver. I am not sure what you mean by \"borderline spleen\". If you have a mildly enlarged liver, then it is important to take care of your liver. I would advise you to cut down on alcohol and smoking. It is also important to maintain a healthy weight and to avoid oily food and junk food. I hope this helps. I wish you well. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions. I would be glad to help you again. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Have a nice day.
Hello, I am glad to help you out with this question. I have gone through the reference documents and have come up with the following answer. The bump is a bruise and should be fine in a few days.

Hi there. Thank you for your question. From the information provided, it sounds like you are suffering from Chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is a condition where the lungs are constantly inflamed and irritated. This can be from smoking or exposure to other irritants. In your case, it appears to be from exposure to mold. You may have been exposed to mold before you moved, and it has taken this long for you to develop chronic bronchitis. You may also have developed a mold allergy. I would suggest getting a chest x-ray to rule out any other lung disease such as pneumonia or lung cancer. You should also see an allergist for allergy testing to determine if you have developed an allergy to mold. If you have developed a mold allergy, you will need to avoid exposure to mold as much as possible. This will include avoiding the use of certain cleaners that can cause mold to grow in your home. You will also need to clean your air conditioner and any other humid areas of your home on a regular basis to prevent mold from growing. I would also suggest using a dehumidifier to reduce the amount of moisture in your home. I hope this helps. Take care and have a great day!
Hi, Thanks for writing in. A discomfort in upper left abdominal area after eating can be due to gastritis, esophagitis, gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, pancreatitis, gall bladder problems etc. In the context of your history of polycystic ovarian disease, there is a possibility that the symptoms could be due to gastritis, esophagitis, gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease. The fact that the symptoms are aggravated after eating supports the above diagnosis. It is not related to the polycystic ovarian disease. Please consult a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management. Hope this helps.
Hi, I have been diagnosed with cervical foraminal stenosis, stenosis, osteoarthritis and degenerative disc issues at C4,5 down to T1. At 45 this does not bode well since the foraminal opening for the nerve feeding through to the left Ulnar nerve is being continually squeezed by progressive bone growth. At the current time, spinal injections keep the inflammation in check around the opening but as the bone continues to grow, these will eventually fail and other trouble areas will likewise begin causing loss of limb function. Any suggestions on controlling inflammation at these sites? I am assuming there is nothing short of surgery that can be done about the foraminal opening closing off with bone growth with resulting nerve death and paralysis of the assoc. limb. I understand your concern. I am also a sufferer of cervical spondylitis and cervical disc prolapse. I am not a medical practitioner but have been through a lot of pain and suffering.

Hi, your husband has undergone the following procedures, I guess:1) Snip done around 9 years ago (varicose vein surgery, ligation and stripping of the superficial veins)2) Bleeding in the testis area (probably a ruptured varicose vein)3) Left testis removal (due to testicular torsion or necrosis secondary to the ruptured varicose vein)The pain and burning sensation running down the inside of the left leg is due to nerve injury caused by the surgery. The sensation running down the same area is due to the scar tissue (healed tissue) in the left testis area, which is causing the pain. Hope this helps.

Hello, I read your question, and I understand your concern. I am sorry for your situation. HGH therapy is a treatment that is not indicated for anxiety or depression. It is a treatment for growth hormone deficiency. In your case, I do not think it would be of any help. I suggest you to consult a psychiatrist for a good treatment for your depression and anxiety. I hope to have been of help.
Hi, I understand your problem, but it's hard to know what is going on from the symptoms you describe. I would recommend that you have a physical examination done by a doctor. This may help to determine the source of the problem. I would also recommend that you get a blood test for rheumatoid factor and other autoimmune diseases. This may help to determine the source of the problem. I would also recommend that you get an MRI of your spine. This may help to determine the source of the problem. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Thanks for your question! I am sorry to hear about the lump you have noticed. I am not sure what exactly you are feeling, but I can tell you that the esophagus is located in the middle of the neck, and it is a tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. The trachea (windpipe) is located just behind the esophagus, and it is a tube that carries air to the lungs. I am not sure what you are feeling, but I would suggest that you see a doctor to get it checked out. If it is a normal finding, then there is nothing to worry about. If it is not a normal finding, then there may be something wrong, and you should see a doctor. I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Hi there. I am not sure what you mean by raised IGA. You mentioned she is allergic to egg whites and other things. If you can tell me what she is allergic to, I can help you find a treatment.

I would be happy to help you out. Take care.
Hi, thanks for providing your health concern. I have carefully read through your query and here's what I think. I think you have developed an allergic reaction to the insect bites. I recommend you to take a course of antihistamine like levocetirizine. This would help you to reduce the swelling and itching. You should also take a course of anti-inflammatory painkiller like Diclofenac. This would help to reduce the inflammation and pain. I hope that answers your query. If you have any further query, I will be happy to help.
Hi, I think you should go back to the hospital with your son, as these symptoms can be indicative of cardiac problems. You should tell the doctors that the x-ray was fine, so that they can look for other possibilities. If the x-ray was normal, the doctors will look for other causes, such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or a heart condition such as heart failure. The doctors will do blood tests to see if there is an infection, and they may give him antibiotics or steroids if there is an infection. They may also do tests on his lungs, such as a spirometry, which measures how much air he can inhale and exhale. I hope this helps.
Hi, I have read your query and can understand your concern. If the baby is developing normally, then there is no need to worry about the hearing test. You should have concern if there is any delay in developmental milestones like sitting, walking, speaking, etc. You can also consult a pediatrician regarding the same. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you. In case of any doubt, I will be available for follow-ups. Take care.
Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  Thanks for writing your query. The lump on the neck is most likely a soft tissue swelling. As it is not painful, it could be a cyst or a lipoma. You can take a course of antibiotics and painkillers for few days to see if it subsides. If it persists then you have to consult your doctor and get it evaluated. Hope this answers your query.
Hi, I understand your concern. But there is no information in your query about how old your partner is. If she is not in her reproductive age, you don't have to worry about pregnancy. If she is in her reproductive age, I would like to know when was her last menstrual period. If it was more than 10 days ago, I suggest she take a pregnancy test. If she is pregnant, I suggest she see her doctor to discuss about the options for pregnancy termination. If she is not pregnant, she should take a contraceptive pill for the next 7 days. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Hi, I understand your concern.  Based on your description, it seems that you are having thickened skin.  It is difficult to tell what is causing it without seeing it.  There are many things that can cause thickened skin.  It is important to know what you have been doing to your skin and the rest of your body.  I suggest that you make an appointment with your doctor so that he can look at your skin and determine what is causing it. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is possible that the tiny red dots on your legs are related to your cancer. Cancer can cause a number of skin changes. There are a number of skin disorders related to cancer such as Livedo reticularis, acrocyanosis, acanthosis nigricans, etc. Livedo reticularis is a condition characterized by a net-like pattern of reddish to blue discoloration. It is common in cancer patients and can be present on the legs. Acrocyanosis is characterized by bluish discoloration of the extremities. It can be associated with cancer. Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by dark, thickened patches of skin. It can be seen in cancer patients. The treatment of these skin conditions depends on the severity of the condition and the type of cancer. You should consult a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment. Hope this helps.
Hi there. Based on your question, it seems that you have had aortic valve replacement, and your LV ejection fraction has increased from 18% to 62% which is good. But now you are suffering from fluid overload. Fluid overload means that you have too much fluid in your body, and it can be caused by heart failure, kidney failure, liver failure, etc. In your case, the most likely cause of fluid overload is heart failure. Lasix is a diuretic which helps in the removal of excess fluid from your body. However, you are retaining the fluids even after taking lasix. This means that your heart is not able to pump the blood properly and hence the fluid is not getting out of your body. You should consult your cardiologist for further evaluation and management. I hope this helps. Best wishes.
Hello, your symptoms could be due to pulmonary hypertension. You need to be investigated for pulmonary hypertension and also for atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which the blood pressure in the pulmonary vessels is increased. It leads to symptoms like dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue etc. It is diagnosed by echocardiography and pulmonary artery catheterization. Atrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia. It is diagnosed by ECG. Pulmonary hypertension and atrial fibrillation are related to each other. So you need to be investigated for both the conditions. Thanks.
Thanks for asking on Chat Doctor I understand your concern. You can use calamine lotion for her to apply to the skin to reduce the itching. Calamine lotion can be applied to the affected areas 3-4 times a day. You can use paracetamol syrup for her fever and pain. Paracetamol syrup can be given 15 mg per kg body weight 4-6 hourly. If she has nasal congestion, you can use nasal saline spray to help clear her nose. Nasal saline spray can be used 2-3 times a day. If she has a runny nose, you can use a decongestant such as phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine. Phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine can be given 2-3 times a day. If she has a cough, you can use a cough suppressant such as dextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan can be given 2-3 times a day. I hope this will help you. Take care.
Hi there. Based on the symptoms you have described, I suspect that your child has gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines that is caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasites. It is most commonly caused by a virus and is often referred to as the "stomach bug".  The most common symptoms of gastroenteritis are vomiting and watery diarrhea.  Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, fever, and dehydration.  Gastroenteritis is usually a self-limiting illness, meaning that it will go away on its own after a few days.  However, it is important to make sure that your child is getting enough fluids to prevent dehydration.  I would recommend giving your child plenty of fluids to drink and offering them small amounts of food throughout the day.  If your child is not improving or if they are getting worse, you should take them to see a doctor. I hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with. Take care!
HelloWelcome to ChatDoctorI have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your details I would advise you to consult a pulmonologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment. You might be having a respiratory tract infection, and it needs a proper examination to rule out the cause of your symptoms. You need to take the antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications as advised by your GP. Hope your query is adequately answered.

Hello, I have read your question carefully and understand your concern. From the description, it seems that your cousin is suffering from some psychiatric illness. I would advise you to take him to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and management. He needs to undergo certain tests and investigations to rule out any underlying medical cause for his illness. I hope this answers your question. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask.
Hi, and thanks for using Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. The shot you are given is for the induction of ovulation. Your doctor has probably diagnosed you with polycystic ovarian disease. This condition causes the follicles in the ovary to not rupture and release the ovum. The shot you are given is a human chorionic gonadotropin shot. This shot is given to induce the rupture of the follicles and the release of the ovum. This way, the ovum will be ready to be fertilized by the sperm. The reason you are asked not to have sex till the 12th day of your period is because your ovulation is likely to occur between the 14th and 16th day of the cycle. The shot will make your ovulation occur earlier. You should have sex between the 11th and 13th day of the cycle. This will ensure that the sperm is available to fertilize the ovum when it is released. Hope this answers your question. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Hi, thanks for your question.  I think you are suffering from a viral infection, such as rubella or chickenpox.  However, I recommend that you see a doctor to confirm this.  I hope this helps.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Hi, your symptoms may be due to orthostatic hypotension or postural orthostatic tachycardia syn drome. In orthostatic hypotension the blood pressure decreases when standing or sitting up and the heart rate increases to compensate for the drop in blood pressure. In postural orthostatic tachycardia syn drome the blood pressure remains normal but the heart rate increases more than usual when standing or sitting up. The cause may be related to autonomic insufficiency. I would recommend you to have a check up with your doctor and get a blood pressure and heart rate measurement when you are in a supine position and when you are standing up. This will help determine whether you have orthostatic hypotension or postural orthostatic tachycardia syn drome. You may also want to have a check up with a neurologist to rule out any other causes such as a viral illness. I hope this helps. If you have any further questions, please let me know. Best regards,
Hi, I am Chat Doctor. I think you have developed a skin infection. You need to take a course of antibiotics to get rid of the infection.

Thanks for asking on Chat Doctor I understand your concern. Yes, if you fall on a hard surface, it is possible to damage your ribs and cause a fracture, and it can cause pain. However, it is not possible to cause a lung injury without a rib fracture. I suggest you get a chest X-ray done to rule out a rib fracture. If it is normal, no need to worry, it will heal on its own. Take painkiller for pain relief. Hope it helps. Regards.
Hi, I am sorry to hear about the back injury you have sustained. If the injury is not too severe, you can use ice packs to reduce swelling and pain, and use painkillers like ibuprofen or naproxen to help with the pain. You should avoid heavy lifting for a while. If the pain persists, or if the injury is severe, you should visit a doctor for further evaluation. I hope this helps. Take care!
Hi, I am not sure what brahmalin ghruta is. I would recommend you to take some good multivitamin and minerals supplement for your son. Also, I would suggest you to give him a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Also, you can give him some omega-3 fatty acids, which is a good supplement for memory and concentration. It is also a good supplement for your son to take at the time of exams. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.
Hi, I am sorry to hear about the condition of your brother. But, there is no surgical treatment available for the condition of your brother. As the condition is caused by the polio virus, which has attacked the nerves in the leg and caused loss of function of the nerves, there is no way to reverse the damage to the nerves. So, it is not possible to cure the condition through surgery. I would suggest you to try physiotherapy and other rehabilitation techniques to help your brother regain as much function of the leg as possible. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Hi, thanks for asking. Based on your description, it seems that you are suffering from a urinary tract infection. The presence of sand in the kidney as seen on ultrasound and increased pus cells in urine is a sign of an infection. The pain in your back near the spinal cord is likely due to the infection, and it is not uncommon to experience pain in the back due to a urinary tract infection. The vomiting is also a common symptom of a urinary tract infection. The use of ciprofloxacin for five days may not be sufficient to treat the infection, as it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and may not be effective against all types of bacteria. I would recommend that you continue taking the ciprofloxacin for the full course as prescribed by your doctor, and also take the pain medication as prescribed. In addition to this, I would recommend that you continue to drink plenty of water and use a washroom for urine every five minutes. This will help flush out the bacteria from your urinary tract and help alleviate the infection. I would also recommend that you continue to monitor your urine output and urine color, as well as your pain levels. If your symptoms persist or worsen, I would recommend that you visit your doctor again for a re-evaluation and further treatment. I hope this helps. Take care.
Hi, I am Chat Doctor, I am sorry about your condition, I have read your question with care and understand your concern. Your doctor is right, these are the signs of TB, but not always it is present, so you need to do the TB test to be sure, and if you are not sure it is TB, you can do the biopsy of the pericardium, to see if it is TB or not. I hope my answer has satisfied you.
Hi, I am sorry to hear about your baby's problems.  I can understand your concern.  The loud gurgling noises in your baby's abdomen are due to gas in the intestines.  This is a common problem in babies, especially when they are fed with breast milk.  It is also common for babies to pass gas in the form of burping or farting.  If the baby is passing gas, then it is not necessary to feed the baby more.  I hope this helps, and I wish your baby well.
Hi there. I am so sorry that you have a painful wound. It sounds like your wound may be infected. The clear watery stuff that you are seeing could be pus (a sign of infection). I would recommend that you contact your doctor for an examination of the wound to see if you need a change in treatment or if you need antibiotics. I hope that this helps. Take care.
Thanks for your question! I will try to help you as much as I can. I am not sure I understand your question. Do you mean that your daughter is growing very fast? If so, then it is normal for her to be taller than the average child her age. If she is growing very fast, then she may be taller than most of the children in her school. She may also have a tendency to be clumsy. This is because she is growing very fast and she may have difficulty keeping up with her body. This can be a difficult time for your daughter. She may be teased at school. I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any more questions.
Thanks for asking your question. I am sorry to hear about the infection and the rash. I hope that your infection is cleared up soon. It sounds like you have a rash that is quite severe. I would recommend that you visit your doctor and have him or her take a look at it. I think that you might need an antibiotic cream to apply to the rash. I hope that helps.

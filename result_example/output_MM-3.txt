As a 15-year-old with small, non-itchy, non-painful bumps on the penis shaft, possible causes include pearly penile papules, Fordyce spots, or benign skin growths. These are generally harmless and not contagious. However, it's important to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis, especially if they change in appearance or cause concern. Avoid self-diagnosis and seek medical evaluation to rule out any serious conditions. It's okay to talk to a trusted adult or healthcare professional; your health is important.
As a 31-year-old female with a history of DVT on warfarin (coumadin), you should avoid supplements like Jack3D, which contains stimulants and ephedra-like compounds that can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and risk of clot formation. These ingredients may interfere with anticoagulation and pose cardiovascular risks. Always consult your physician before starting any supplement. Focus on safe pre-workout options like caffeine in moderation, creatine, or branched-chain amino acids, under medical guidance. Ensure INR levels are stable before increasing physical activity.
Based on your description, recurrent nerve-related symptoms (shocks, numbness) in the leg and trapezius following exercise may suggest a neurological issue, such as a compressed nerve (e.g., sciatic or cervical radiculopathy). While a previous diagnosis of "nerve pinch" was made, persistent or new symptoms warrant further evaluation. Consider imaging (MRI of spine) and nerve conduction studies. Avoid strenuous exercise until assessed. Consult a neurologist for proper diagnosis and management. Do not ignore recurring symptoms, as they could indicate an underlying condition requiring treatment.
Given your persistent chest pain, green/yellow phlegm with red spots, fatigue, and history of asthma, it's concerning and warrants further evaluation. The presence of blood in sputum (hemoptysis) and ongoing symptoms despite treatment suggests the need for urgent review. You should return to your GP or A&E for reassessment, possibly including a CT scan, sputum culture, and closer monitoring. Do not delay care; persistent symptoms may indicate a more serious condition such as pneumonia, pleuritis, or other underlying issues. Continue prescribed meds but seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen.
A 47-year-old female with no cardiac history, experiencing slight ECG changes compared to 2 years ago, could have variations due to factors like weight gain, reduced physical activity, or hormonal changes. However, it's important to rule out new cardiac pathology. Consider repeating ECG, stress test, and possibly echocardiogram to assess for any underlying issues. Discuss these findings with a cardiologist for further evaluation and management.
If your daughter's dog bite is healing but still has bumps under the scars, it may indicate scar tissue formation or a residual infection; while cocoa butter can help with skin hydration, it does not treat underlying issues. It is advisable to have her evaluated by a healthcare provider to rule out complications such as abscesses, keloid formation, or persistent infection. A doctor may recommend imaging or further treatment if needed. Do not delay seeking medical attention if there are signs of redness, swelling, pain, or fever.
Hello Shikha, your symptoms of muscle twitches starting from the lower lip and spreading to other areas could be due to electrolyte imbalance, anxiety, or early neurological conditions. Your slightly low calcium (2 points below normal) may contribute, but is likely not the sole cause. Continue with calcium supplements as advised. Anxiety medications (Zapiz and Ciplar) may help if anxiety is exacerbating symptoms. However, persistent or worsening twitching warrants further evaluation, including nerve conduction studies or EMG, to rule out conditions like ALS or neuropathy. Monitor for new symptoms and follow up with your neurologist. Stay calm, as stress can worsen symptoms.
Poor circulation in the legs can be caused by several factors, including peripheral artery disease (PAD), varicose veins, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or even nerve-related issues. Symptoms like leg fatigue and aching may also be due to prolonged standing, sedentary lifestyle, or obesity. It's important to assess for risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Consider diagnostic evaluation with ankle-brachial index (ABI) or Doppler ultrasound. Encourage lifestyle modifications, regular exercise, and consult a healthcare provider for further assessment and management.
Lower abdominal pain near the uterus after stopping birth control pills could be due to hormonal fluctuations, menstrual cycle changes, or possible underlying conditions like endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Since you have a history of endometrial hyperplasia, it's important to monitor symptoms. The pain might be related to your upcoming period or an early menstrual cycle change. If the pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by fever, abnormal bleeding, or other concerning symptoms, consult a gynecologist for evaluation, including pelvic exam and possibly ultrasound to rule out complications. Continue monitoring your symptoms and seek medical advice if they worsen.
Cholelithiasis (gallstones) may not always require surgery, especially if asymptomatic. If you're experiencing symptoms like pain, nausea, or fever, your doctor's recommendation for surgery (cholecystectomy) is likely due to complications. Non-surgical options include medications like ursodeoxycholic acid to dissolve small stones, but this can take months and isn't always effective. Home remedies like staying hydrated, eating a low-fat diet, and avoiding rapid weight loss may help manage symptoms. However, if stones cause recurrent issues, surgery is often the most reliable solution. Discuss your concerns with your doctor to explore all options based on your specific condition.
Your friend's symptoms could indicate a functional gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional dyspepsia, but other causes like gastritis, peptic ulcer, or even anxiety-related issues should be considered. The episodic nature of the pain lasting minutes to hours suggests possible spastic or motility disorders. A thorough evaluation including H. pylori testing, abdominal ultrasound, and possibly endoscopy may be needed. Over-the-counter antacids or proton pump inhibitors may help if acid-related, but consult a physician for proper diagnosis and treatment. Avoid self-medicating.
It is not uncommon to have a flap of gum tissue following wisdom tooth extraction, especially if there was significant swelling or if the surgical site required closure. The flap may be part of the healing process and could be adhering to adjacent tissues. However, if the flap appears loose, painful, or is not healing, it may indicate a possible dehiscence or infection. Ensure you are following post-operative care instructions, and if there is persistent discomfort, foul odor, or increasing swelling, contact your surgeon for an evaluation. Proper stitch placement is typically confirmed during the procedure, but a follow-up visit may be necessary to assess healing.
Smoking even once during pregnancy can harm your baby, as nicotine and harmful chemicals can cross the placenta, potentially affecting fetal development, increasing risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and developmental issues. Withdrawal symptoms are common, but quitting is crucial for your baby's health. Consider counseling, support groups, or nicotine replacement therapy (if approved by your doctor) to manage cravings. Seek immediate medical advice to discuss safe strategies to quit and protect your pregnancy.
Your knee pain with fluid retention could indicate an underlying issue such as arthritis, gout, infection, or a ligament injury. It's important to evaluate for redness, warmth, swelling, and limited range of motion. Consider imaging like X-ray or MRI and blood tests to check for inflammation or infection. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation may help. Consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
It's important to follow up with a dermatologist for persistent rashes, as they can evaluate for conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or recurrent infections.

Avoid self-medicating with multiple analgesics without medical guidance.
Hernias can vary in consistency, but many are firm or hard due to the protrusion of tissue through a weakened area. A Spigelian hernia occurs along the semilunar line, and your description fits this location. However, a proper evaluation with imaging (e.g., ultrasound or CT) is needed for confirmation. Hernia repair can cause postoperative pain, which varies by individual and surgical technique; however, significant pain is not typical and may indicate complications. Consult a surgeon for assessment and management.
Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints. Management includes NSAIDs like Etoricoxib, DMARDs, biologics, and exercise. Your son's symptoms suggest disease activity; consider discussing with his rheumatologist about adjusting medications, possibly adding a TNF inhibitor. Regular exercise, especially physiotherapy, is crucial for maintaining mobility. With proper treatment and lifestyle modifications, he can lead a normal life. Avoid self-medication; follow-up is essential.
Your symptoms of a neck lump, earache, and prior sore throat could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process, such as lymphadenopathy due to viral or bacterial infection. Given your age and weight, while less likely, it's important to rule out more serious causes. A thorough evaluation including physical exam, possibly imaging (ultrasound), and lab tests (CBC, CRP) may be needed. Monitor for fever, weight loss, or night sweats. Follow up with your physician for further assessment to determine the cause and appropriate management.
Your symptoms suggest a possible form of physical urticaria, such as solar or cold-induced urticaria, where exposure to environmental factors triggers a rash. The redness, warmth, and itching on your face and neck after outdoor exposure, especially in wind and cold, are consistent with this. It is important to consult a dermatologist for evaluation, including possible patch testing or phototesting. Avoiding known triggers, using antihistamines, and applying soothing topical treatments may help. If symptoms worsen or involve swelling, seek urgent care.
Masturbation is a normal and healthy sexual activity with no harmful effects on muscle growth or overall health. The idea that it is "energy suicide" is a myth without scientific basis. There is no recommended frequency; do it as needed without causing distress. If you feel uncomfortable, reflect on your emotional state, but there's no medical reason to limit it. Focus on balanced nutrition, adequate sleep, and proper training for muscle development. Consult a healthcare provider if anxiety persists.
A whitish-red lump on the gums that fluctuates in size, bleeds when irritated, and changes with eating could be a variety of conditions, including an abscess, cyst, or reactive hyperplasia. While cancer is possible, it's less likely without additional risk factors. Evaluate for infection, trauma, or periodontal issues. Consult a dentist or oral surgeon for clinical examination, imaging, and possible biopsy to determine the cause. Avoid self-manipulation to prevent complications. Early evaluation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
Your partner may have a cervical spine injury despite not having immediate symptoms like headache or nausea. Numbness is concerning and could indicate nerve involvement.

If he refuses care, monitor for worsening symptoms (e.g., weakness, difficulty moving, loss of sensation) and consider contacting a trusted friend or family member to check on him. Your concern is valid; better safe than sorry.
Fertisure (containing folic acid, vitamin B12, and antioxidants) is typically used for 3-6 months to improve sperm motility. Results may vary, but improvements in sperm parameters are often seen within 3 months. Continue the medication as prescribed, and re-evaluate after 3 months with a semen analysis. Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding heat exposure, smoking, and alcohol, can also enhance results. Consult your doctor for further evaluation if no improvement is noted.
Your friend's situation requires careful medical evaluation. Hypertension during pregnancy increases risks, but with proper management, some women can have healthy pregnancies. She should consult a high-risk pregnancy specialist (maternal-fetal medicine) to assess her condition and explore options. Lifestyle modifications, blood pressure monitoring, and medications safe during pregnancy may help. Previous abortions don't necessarily preclude a successful pregnancy. She should discuss her desire to continue the pregnancy openly with her doctor, who can provide personalized guidance and support.
It is concerning that your heart rate remains fast despite being on Losartan and Diltiazem. The combination may not be adequately controlling your heart rate or blood pressure, especially after a rebound hypertensive episode from clonidine withdrawal. Anxiety can also contribute to increased heart rate. You should monitor your BP and heart rate regularly, and contact your physician promptly for possible dose adjustment or additional evaluation, including checking for arrhythmias or other underlying issues. Do not stop medications without medical advice.
Your symptoms of weight gain, periorbital puffiness, and finger swelling could indicate fluid retention, which may be related to heart failure, kidney dysfunction, or medication side effects. Insulin and liraglutide (Victoza) can sometimes contribute to fluid retention. It is important to evaluate for possible heart failure (e.g., BNP/NT-proBNP, ECHO) and renal function (creatinine, eGFR). Consider checking for edema causes and review your medications. Consult your physician for further assessment and potential adjustments.
You are 298 years old? That is not possible. Please clarify your age. Regarding your symptoms—chest tightness, fatigue, shortness of breath, heartburn, and shoulder/neck pain—these could indicate serious conditions such as heart disease, acid reflux, or musculoskeletal issues. Given your weight gain and symptoms, it's important to see a healthcare provider for evaluation, including an EKG, chest X-ray, and blood tests. Anxiety and depression can also contribute, but underlying medical issues must be ruled out. Do not delay seeking care. No, you do not pay for this service; it's free.
Increased burning pain and numbness in the thumb three weeks post-surgery could indicate nerve irritation, scar tissue formation, or incomplete release. Persistent pain despite acetaminophen suggests possible complications. Avoid NSAIDs due to gastrointestinal issues, but consider discussing alternative analgesics like gabapentin with your surgeon. Follow up promptly for evaluation, including possible nerve conduction studies or imaging, to rule out neuropathy or surgical complications. Rest, ice, and activity modification may help, but professional assessment is critical.
Swelling in the ankles, especially after starting a job involving prolonged sitting, could be due to fluid retention or poor circulation. While you're on hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic), swelling may indicate inadequate response to the medication, possible side effects, or an underlying condition such as heart, kidney, or liver disease. It's also possible that the diuretic is not sufficient for your current situation. Consider consulting your physician for evaluation, including checking kidney function, electrolytes, and possibly assessing for deep vein thrombosis or other causes. Adjustments to your medication or additional tests may be needed.
Given your situation, option 1 (implant) or 2 (bridge) are more definitive solutions to prevent food lodgment. A bridge preserves adjacent teeth but requires altering a healthy tooth, while an implant is independent but involves surgery. Option 3 (replacing the cap) may temporarily help if the original restoration was poorly fitted, but if the tooth structure is compromised, it may not resolve the issue. Leaving the root-canaled tooth without a cap risks further decay and infection. Consult your dentist for a thorough evaluation to determine the best long-term solution based on your oral health and preferences.
Hi Devi, hair loss after childbirth and while breastfeeding can be due to postpartum telogen effluvium, which is common. However, ongoing hair loss despite Thyronorm 50mg and multivitamins suggests possible undertreatment of hypothyroidism or other deficiencies. Ensure your TSH levels are within the optimal range (preferably <2.5 mIU/L). Also, check for iron, ferritin, vitamin D, and B12 levels. Consult your doctor for thyroid function test and blood workup to rule out other causes. It's not normal to have persistent hair loss; further evaluation is needed.
Probable diagnosis: Autoimmune hepatitis (elevated bilirubin, liver enzymes, and positive ANA) with mild hepatitis on ultrasound. Management: Consult a hepatologist for further evaluation, including liver biopsy. Monitor for complications, ensure adequate nutrition, avoid hepatotoxins, and consider immunosuppressive therapy if autoimmune hepatitis is confirmed. Regular follow-up with liver function tests and imaging.
Sharp chest pain can have various causes, including cardiac issues like angina or myocardial infarction, pulmonary conditions such as pleuritis or pneumothorax, musculoskeletal problems, or gastrointestinal disorders like GERD. Given the potential for serious underlying conditions, it is crucial to seek immediate medical evaluation, especially if the pain is severe, radiates to the arm or jaw, or is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness. Diagnostic steps may include an ECG, chest X-ray, and blood tests. Do not delay seeking urgent care.
As an alcohol-dependent individual, your partner requires careful management before dental procedures. Sedation may be necessary due to her gag reflex and anxiety, but alcohol use affects metabolism of sedatives and increases bleeding risk. Dentists may proceed with caution, using lower doses and monitoring closely. She should avoid alcohol for 24-48 hours pre-op if possible, but abrupt cessation can worsen withdrawal. Discuss her situation with the dentist and physician to plan safe sedation, possibly involving a specialist. Ensure she is hydrated, and consider medical clearance before the procedure.
Your symptoms of kidney issues and bleeding gums could indicate a variety of conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, or a systemic illness like lupus.

Avoid irritants and monitor for changes. Schedule an appointment promptly for proper assessment and peace of mind.
At 20 weeks, increased amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) can sometimes be associated with gestational diabetes, which you have been diagnosed with. High blood sugar levels can lead to excess fetal urine production, contributing to increased amniotic fluid. Your baby's other structures are normal, which is reassuring. With proper management of gestational diabetes through diet, exercise, and possibly insulin, the risks to your baby can be minimized. Regular monitoring, including non-stress tests and ultrasounds, will help ensure your baby's well-being. Stay positive, follow your doctor's advice, and attend all prenatal appointments.
Your LFT shows elevated bilirubin (1.57 mg/dL), SGPT (123 U/L), and SGOT (84 U/L), suggesting liver inflammation, likely due to alcohol use and dietary factors. As a frequent drinker (150 ml daily), you are at risk for alcoholic liver disease. With strict abstinence from alcohol, adherence to a healthy diet, and weight management, improvement may occur within 3-6 months. However, full recovery depends on liver damage severity. Avoiding alcohol and spicy non-vegetarian foods is crucial. Consult your physician for further evaluation, including imaging and possibly a liver biopsy. Recovery time varies; long-term abstinence is necessary for sustained improvement.
It is possible that ovulation may have occurred, but pregnancy tests can be inaccurate if taken too early. Wait until your period is late, then take a sensitive pregnancy test. If it's negative and you haven't conceived after 6-12 months of regular unprotected intercourse, consider evaluation for infertility, including semen analysis, hormonal profile, and possibly ultrasound or HSG. Continue tracking ovulation and consult your gynecologist for further guidance.
Your symptoms of sudden, intense abdominal pain, frequent small bowel movements, and the ultrasound findings of mild hepatomegaly with fatty liver (grade I) and borderline spleen suggest possible underlying conditions such as fatty liver disease, gallbladder issues, or gastrointestinal dysfunction. It is important to consult a gastroenterologist for further evaluation, including liver function tests, CBC, and possibly a CT scan or endoscopy. Manage symptoms with a low-fat diet, hydration, and avoid alcohol. Follow-up is essential to rule out more serious conditions.
A hard, tender bump the size of a quarter after trauma is likely a hematoma or a subcutaneous cyst, possibly a sebaceous cyst or a lipoma, which may have become inflamed or infected. If it's painful, red, and warm, consider infection. Monitor for increasing size, fever, or spreading redness. If it persists, grows, or becomes more painful, consult a healthcare provider for evaluation; imaging or drainage may be needed. No immediate concern unless symptoms worsen.
A persistent cough lasting over a year, especially with phlegm and a history of mold exposure, raises concern for chronic bronchitis, asthma, or postnasal drip. Mold exposure can contribute to respiratory issues. Since your previous diagnosis was sinus drainage, consider evaluating for underlying conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recommend a chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests, and possibly a CT scan of the sinuses. Avoid further mold exposure and consult a pulmonologist for a thorough assessment.
Your symptoms of upper left abdominal discomfort, increased firmness, and positional aggravation warrant evaluation for possible gastrointestinal or splenic issues, given your history of PCOS and irregular menses. Consider imaging (e.g., ultrasound) to assess for gallbladder, pancreas, or splenic pathology. Rule out ovarian cysts or torsion if pelvic pain is present. Monitor for fever, vomiting, or jaundice. Consult a physician promptly for accurate diagnosis and management.
Cervical foraminal stenosis with osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease at C4-5 to T1 is a progressive condition. While spinal injections can manage inflammation temporarily, long-term control may require anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., NSAIDs, corticosteroids), physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. However, if bone growth continues and nerve function declines, surgery (e.g., foraminotomy, discectomy, or fusion) may be necessary to prevent permanent nerve damage. Consult a spine specialist for personalized evaluation and to discuss surgical options if conservative measures fail. Early intervention can help preserve limb function.
Your husband's symptoms of pain, burning, and discomfort in the area of his previous orchiectomy, along with sensations during urination, may indicate nerve-related issues such as post-orchectomy syndrome or neuropathic pain. These can occur due to nerve damage during surgery. The burning sensation and referred pain could also suggest pudendal neuralgia or residual inflammation. It is important to consult a urologist for a thorough evaluation, including a physical exam and possibly imaging or nerve conduction studies. Pain management strategies, including medications like gabapentin or pregabalin, may be considered. Ensure he avoids prolonged sitting and discuss any new symptoms promptly.
Your ultrasound findings are largely normal, showing a structurally healthy uterus, ovaries with physiologic follicles, and no free fluid. The endometrium is consistent with the secretory phase, indicating regular menstrual cycle. However, infertility can have multiple causes beyond imaging. Consider evaluating for ovulation, tubal patency, and male factor. Consult a fertility specialist for further assessment, including hormone testing and possibly a hysterosalpingogram. While your anatomy appears normal, additional investigations are needed to determine fertility potential.
Mintop 5 (minoxidil 5%) is a topical treatment for hair loss, but it may take 3-6 months to show significant results. If you've only been using it for 1 month and notice no improvement or increased hair loss, continue as prescribed and monitor for 2-3 more months. Increased shedding can sometimes occur initially due to shedding phase. You can use almond oil or other nourishing oils like jojoba or castor oil; apply them after minoxidil has dried (about 15-30 minutes later) to avoid diluting the medication. Consult your doctor if there's no improvement after 3-4 months.
As a 56-year-old female with stress-induced anxiety and depression, significant weight loss (from 128-130 to 104 lbs) raises concerns about malnutrition, metabolic changes, or underlying medical conditions. While HGH (human growth hormone) may have some benefits in specific cases, it is not FDA-approved for anxiety or weight gain in non-deficient individuals. Low-dose HGH carries risks including fluid retention, joint pain, and insulin resistance. Your primary care provider's concern about further weight loss is valid. Addressing the root cause—your emotional distress from the lawsuit—is critical. Consider psychotherapy, nutritional counseling, and possibly SSRIs for depression/anxiety. HGH should only be considered under endocrinologist supervision after thorough evaluation.
Your persistent left-sided low back pain, worsening in the morning, radiating to the hip, and associated with an elevated RA factor, suggests possible inflammatory or musculoskeletal etiology. Despite normal imaging, consider axial spondyloarthritis (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis) or other autoimmune conditions. Evaluate for HLA-B27, ESR, CRP, and consider a rheumatology referral. Persistent pain without response to standard treatments warrants further investigation, including possible MRI of the sacroiliac joints and consultation with a specialist. Nighttime relief may indicate inflammatory patterns. Avoid prolonged sitting and maintain activity as tolerated.
A lump-like sensation at the base of the neck could be due to several causes, such as an enlarged thyroid, lymph node, or a cyst. Since you have no swallowing difficulties, pain, or other symptoms, it may not be urgent, but it should be evaluated by a healthcare provider to rule out conditions like thyroid nodules or lymphadenopathy. A physical exam and possibly an ultrasound or blood tests (e.g., TSH) may be needed. The shoulder blade discomfort is likely unrelated but should also be assessed if persistent. It's prudent to schedule a clinical evaluation for accurate diagnosis.
Your 5-year-old girl's symptoms—recurrent runny nose, sore eyes, dark under-eye circles, pallor, armpit pain, and a history of elevated IgA and egg white allergy—raise concern for possible chronic allergic conditions, anemia, or systemic illness. Dark circles and pallor may indicate anemia or chronic inflammation. Armpit soreness could be related to lymphadenopathy or infection. Given her declining general condition, urgent evaluation is needed to rule out underlying causes such as anemia, autoimmune disorder, or persistent infection. Recommend immediate pediatric assessment, blood tests (CBC, iron studies, inflammatory markers), and allergy review. Avoid allergens and monitor for fever or worsening symptoms.
Swelling, pain, muscle stiffness, and numbness after bee/wasp stings may indicate a more severe reaction or possible infection; continue icing, elevate the arm, and monitor for worsening symptoms. Continue ibuprofen for pain and inflammation, but if swelling increases, redness spreads, or you develop fever, seek immediate medical attention as this could signal an allergic reaction or infection requiring antibiotics or antihistamines. Avoid scratching the bites and keep the area clean. If numbness persists, consider evaluation for nerve involvement.
Your son's symptoms of chest tightness, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, reduced saliva production, and lack of appetite, lasting two days, warrant further evaluation despite a normal chest X-ray. Consider possible causes such as viral illness, gastroesophageal reflux, or early signs of pneumonia. Monitor for worsening symptoms, fever, or respiratory distress. Ensure he stays hydrated and seek follow-up with a pediatrician or consider an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan if symptoms persist. Avoid self-medication and ensure adequate rest. If symptoms worsen, return to the ER immediately.
Yes, it is prudent to follow the recommendation for a BERA (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry) hearing test. A bilirubin level of 26 mg/dL is significantly high and can increase the risk of kernicterus, which may lead to hearing loss. While not all cases result in permanent damage, early detection through BERA is crucial for timely intervention. The doctors are acting cautiously, as this was an unusual and severe case. Proceeding with the test is a safe and recommended step to ensure your baby's auditory development is not affected.
A painless, soft, fluctuating lump on the neck that is not growing and only painful with pressure could be a benign cyst, such as a sebaceous cyst or a lipoma. However, since it "comes and goes," consider a possible lymph node or a reactive hyperplasia. While two MDs have reassured you it's a muscle issue, persistent findings warrant further evaluation. Consider an ultrasound to characterize the mass. If it changes in size, becomes painful, or is associated with other symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss), consult a specialist for biopsy or further workup. For now, monitor for changes and follow up if concerns persist.
If there was potential for pregnancy after unsafe sex, emergency contraception (like Cycleonorm E & P) can be effective if taken within 72 hours. Since your partner took it on the first day and her period was on December 30, it's important to monitor her next menstrual cycle. If her period is delayed by more than a week, consider a pregnancy test. Continue using barrier methods or discuss ongoing contraception with a healthcare provider. Avoid further unprotected intercourse until a reliable method is in place. Consult a doctor for personalized advice and to rule out any complications.
Your symptoms of thick, hard, and shiny skin could indicate a condition such as scleroderma, which is an autoimmune disorder causing skin thickening. Other possibilities include localized scleroderma, morphea, or even a skin infection. It's important to consult a dermatologist for a proper evaluation, including a physical exam and possibly a biopsy. Avoid self-diagnosis and seek medical attention promptly to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management.
Tiny red dots with white circles on the legs, without itching or pain, could be petechiae, purpura, or possibly a reaction to medication. Given your history of breast cancer and current evaluation for uterine cancer, it's important to consider if this is related to coagulation changes, chemotherapy, or a new lesion. The Percocet was only taken once and is unlikely to be the cause. Consult your physician for a skin examination and possible blood work to evaluate for clotting disorders or metastatic disease. Do not ignore new skin changes in the context of cancer.
Fluid overload means excess fluid in your body, often due to impaired heart function or kidney issues, which can occur after valve replacement. Your reduced ejection fraction (62% from 18%) suggests possible heart failure. The diuretic Lasix (furosemide) is used to reduce fluid retention, but if you're still retaining fluid, your dose may need adjustment or additional therapies. Monitor weight, limit sodium intake, and report symptoms like shortness of breath or swelling. Follow up with your cardiologist for possible echocardiogram or blood tests to assess heart function and kidney health.
Your symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pressure, and elevated heart rate with exertion could suggest pulmonary hypertension, especially given your history of sarcoidosis and lung surgery. Amiodarone and prednisone are used for arrhythmia and inflammation, but your symptoms warrant further evaluation. Consider a right heart catheterization to confirm pulmonary hypertension. Also, assess for residual sarcoidosis activity, lung function, and possible thromboembolism. Consult a pulmonologist for comprehensive assessment and management.
For a 5-month-old with mild symptoms of a runny nose and poor sleep, avoid self-medicating with Coriminc drops or nasal drops without medical advice. These may contain decongestants not suitable for infants. Ensure proper hydration, use a bulb syringe for nasal mucus, and consult a pediatrician for evaluation. Do not use nasal decongestant drops for more than 3 days. A pediatrician can determine if an infection is present and recommend appropriate treatment.
Your child's symptoms—vomiting, watery stools, severe leg pain, and refusal to eat or drink—could indicate a serious condition such as gastroenteritis with dehydration, intussusception, or a systemic infection. The leg pain may be due to abdominal cramping or a more specific issue like a viral illness or even a rare condition like Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Immediate medical evaluation is crucial to rule out life-threatening causes. Ensure she stays hydrated with small sips of oral rehydration solution, monitor for signs of dehydration (dry mouth, no tears, decreased urination), and seek urgent care if symptoms worsen or if she becomes lethargic. Do not delay seeking professional medical attention.
Your mother's symptoms of persistent breathlessness, cough, and reduced urine output despite treatment suggest possible respiratory or cardiac issues. Doxycycline is typically for bacterial infections, while Lactic Acid Bacteria may support gut health. However, her symptoms persisting indicate need for further evaluation. Consider chest X-ray, ECG, and renal function tests. Possible conditions include pneumonia, heart failure, or urinary tract infection. Consult a specialist for accurate diagnosis and management. Avoid self-medication and ensure she stays hydrated.
Based on your description, there may be a hereditary psychiatric condition in the family. Your cousin's symptoms suggest possible anxiety or early signs of a psychotic disorder. Self-medicating with Paroxetine 25 mg without a proper diagnosis is not advisable. It is crucial to consult a psychiatrist for a thorough evaluation, including mental status examination and possibly genetic counseling. Benzodiazepines should only be used under medical supervision due to risk of dependency. Treatment should be individualized, and regular follow-ups are essential to monitor progress and manage side effects. Do not adjust dosages without professional guidance.
The injection is likely a gonadotropin (e.g., hCG) to trigger ovulation, as FERTAB-50 (clomiphene citrate) stimulates follicle development. You should avoid intercourse until day 12 to time conception accurately with the ovulation shot, ensuring optimal egg retrieval and increasing pregnancy chances. Follow your doctor's instructions closely for the best outcome.
Your symptoms of swollen, painful lymph nodes in the neck and chin, along with itchy, pinkish rashes on the face and neck, could indicate an allergic reaction, viral infection, or autoimmune condition such as lupus. Possible causes include contact dermatitis, infectious mononucleosis, or a hypersensitivity reaction. It is important to evaluate for associated symptoms like fever, fatigue, or joint pain. Consider seeing a healthcare provider for a physical exam, blood tests (e.g., CBC, ESR, ANA), and possibly a skin biopsy. Avoid potential allergens and use antihistamines for itching. If symptoms worsen or fever develops, seek medical attention promptly.
Your symptoms—sudden dizziness, double vision, vertigo, nausea, and difficulty looking up—could indicate vestibular neuritis, inner ear disturbance, or even a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Given your history of camping in Big Bend NP, consider possible tick exposure (e.g., Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever) or other environmental factors. Dehydration typically presents with different symptoms. It’s important to see a doctor for a neurological and vestibular evaluation, including possible MRI or blood tests, to rule out serious causes. Rest, hydration, and avoiding sudden head movements may help, but professional assessment is crucial.
It sounds like a possible contact dermatitis or viral exanthem; given the spread among friends, consider contagious causes like molluscum contagiosum or herpes simplex. Avoid hot showers, use mild soap, and apply over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream. Monitor for itching, blisters, or fever. If it worsens or spreads, see a doctor for evaluation, including possible swab or culture to identify the cause. Avoid close contact until diagnosed.
A fall causing deep pain under the rib near the waist in an 84-year-old warrants concern for possible rib fracture, lung contusion, or splenic injury. While bruising may not be visible, internal damage can occur. Given your age and the persistent pain, an X-ray is advisable to rule out fractures or pulmonary issues. Consider CT if trauma is significant. Monitor for shortness of breath, chest pain, or abdominal tenderness. Consult a physician promptly for evaluation.
It is concerning that you are experiencing localized bruising and radiating pain after a forceful back manipulation. While some discomfort can occur after spinal adjustments, the presence of bruising and radiation to the upper buttocks raises concern for possible soft tissue injury, muscle strain, or even a vertebral fracture, especially given the significant force applied. I recommend seeking immediate medical evaluation, including imaging such as X-ray or MRI, to rule out fractures, disc issues, or nerve involvement. In the meantime, avoid activities that exacerbate the pain, apply ice, and consider over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication. A healthcare provider can assess your condition and guide appropriate treatment.
Brahmalin Ghruta is an Ayurvedic formulation, but there is limited scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for improving memory or concentration in adolescents. For a 14-year-old with no medical history, it is not advisable to use unproven supplements. Dosage and safety are not well-established for this age group. Stress during exams can be managed through adequate sleep, study habits, and relaxation techniques. Consult a pediatrician before starting any supplement to ensure safety and appropriateness.
Polio can cause permanent muscle atrophy and limb asymmetry. While surgery cannot reverse nerve damage, procedures like tendon transfers or osteotomies may improve function and appearance. Consult a neurosurgeon or orthopedic specialist for evaluation. Hospitals like AIIMS, Apollo, or Fortis in India have experienced teams. Psychological support is also crucial for self-esteem. Always seek a comprehensive assessment before deciding on surgery.
Your symptoms suggest a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) or kidney stones, given the RBCs, pus cells, and back pain. Ciprofloxacin is appropriate, but if symptoms persist after 5 days, you may need a different antibiotic or further evaluation. Vomiting and severe pain could indicate a more serious condition like pyelonephritis or obstructing kidney stone. Continue hydrating, but consult your doctor immediately for repeat imaging (e.g., CT scan) and possibly a urine culture. Avoid self-medicating; seek urgent care if fever, nausea, or inability to urinate develops.
Based on your chest X-ray findings, "hilar glands increased" and "prominent broncho-vascular markings" may suggest old or resolving pulmonary tuberculosis, or other chronic lung conditions. Since your symptoms were mild and current X-ray showed no active TB, it's likely you had a past infection. No active treatment is needed unless symptoms persist. Monitor for persistent cough, weight loss, or night sweats. If symptoms recur, consider sputum AFB smear and culture, or CT chest. Consult a pulmonologist for further evaluation if concerns persist.
Your newborn's symptoms suggest possible infantile colic or gastrointestinal discomfort, possibly related to lactose intolerance, feeding technique, or gas. The bloated, hard tummy, gurgling sounds, and frequent regurgitation are concerning. Ensure proper latching during feeds to reduce air intake. Burp her frequently. Monitor for signs of dehydration, poor weight gain, or fever. If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a pediatrician promptly for evaluation, including possible assessment for cow's milk protein allergy or other causes. Continue breastfeeding, as it is beneficial, but consider discussing with a healthcare provider about possible dietary adjustments or further investigations.
Your symptoms—throbbing pain, shooting pain up your hand, and clear watery drainage—could indicate an infection despite initial treatment. Monitor for redness, swelling, warmth, fever, or foul-smelling discharge. Continue keeping the wound clean and covered, avoid using the hand unnecessarily, and consult your doctor promptly for evaluation. They may need to assess for infection, possibly prescribe antibiotics, or adjust care. Do not ignore worsening symptoms.
Your daughter's height is within the normal range, but her recent behavioral changes—restlessness, involuntary movements, facial expressions, clumsiness, and difficulty sitting still—could indicate a neurological or developmental condition such as Tourette syndrome, ADHD, or a movement disorder. These symptoms are not typical for her age and warrant evaluation by a pediatrician or neurologist. Diagnostic steps may include a thorough history, physical exam, and possibly imaging or blood tests to rule out underlying causes. Early assessment is important for appropriate management and support.
Your symptoms suggest a possible genital infection, possibly a fungal or bacterial infection, or contact dermatitis, which may be exacerbated by the UTI. Continue your antibiotic as prescribed, but consult a healthcare provider for evaluation of the rash. Avoid scratching, keep the area clean and dry, and consider over-the-counter antifungal cream (e.g., clotrimazole) if fungal infection is suspected. Avoid irritants, wear loose clothing, and apply a soothing moisturizer. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention promptly for proper diagnosis and treatment.
At 39 weeks pregnant, experiencing chills, shaking, and decreased fetal movement warrants immediate medical attention. Chills could indicate an infection or other underlying issue, while reduced fetal movement may signal fetal distress. Please contact your healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency department promptly for evaluation, including a non-stress test and ultrasound to assess the baby's well-being. Do not delay care, as timely intervention is critical. Stay hydrated and monitor for other symptoms like fever, contractions, or fluid leakage.
Your symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of agoraphobia with panic attacks, which can lead to severe avoidance of places or situations that might cause panic, helplessness, or embarrassment. It is crucial to consult a psychiatrist or psychologist for a proper evaluation. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication such as SSRIs may be beneficial. Gradual exposure therapy can help reduce fear. Please seek professional help immediately; you are not alone, and effective treatments are available. Do not hesitate to reach out to a mental health provider in your area.
Your symptoms—bright red blood from the anus, history of diabetes, hypertension, anemia, peripheral artery disease, and previous coronary stents—raise concerns for gastrointestinal bleeding. Polyps found on endoscopy may be benign but require biopsy to rule out malignancy. Given your age and risk factors, colorectal cancer cannot be ruled out. You should undergo colonoscopy with biopsy of the polyps, complete blood count, stool occult blood test, and evaluation for source of bleeding. Consult a gastroenterologist and oncologist for further management. Maintain good glycemic control and monitor for signs of worsening anemia or bleeding.
Swelling in one foot after a long trip could indicate deep vein thrombosis (DVT), especially with your history of heart surgery and diuretic use. Elevate the foot, avoid prolonged sitting, and consider compression stockings. However, consult your physician promptly for assessment, possibly including a Doppler ultrasound to rule out DVT. Avoid self-treatment with ice if there's concern for circulation issues. Monitor for redness, warmth, or pain, which may suggest thrombophlebitis or infection. Adjust activity as needed, and ensure adequate hydration.

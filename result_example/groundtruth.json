Course home remedies,   plz help me", "output": "Hi, How are you? My name is Chat Doctor.  I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I will attempt to answer your question. Cholelithiasis or gall bladder stones is a very common finding in scans of the abdomen. 10% to 20% of population will develop stones at some time in their lifetime. Up to 80% of these patients will never experience biliary pain or complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis.  Hence, most gallstones are clinically \"silent,\" and is an incidental finding often uncovered during abdominal ultrasound being performed for another reason. People with such asymptomatic cholelithiasis, however, eventually may develop symptoms (biliary pain) that require treatment, but this risk is quite low. An even lower proportion (1-2%) may develop major gallstone complications. Therefore, expectant management is an appropriate choice for silent gallstones in the general population. The exception is patients at high risk for experiencing biliary complications - Large gallstones (>3 cm) or gallbladders crammed with stones that carry a higher risk of developing gallbladder cancer. So in your case if you are currently not suffering from any symptoms and all you have is a small stone in the GB, I would advise a \"wait and watch\" policy. If in future you do develop symptoms like pain, fever, omitting, dyspepsia, etc. then I would get operated on. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a fairly simple and routine surgery done in most surgical centers. Unfortunately once the stones have been formed, there are no medications which will help in treating them. Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better soon. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further clarifications. Have a great day"}

Chronic inflammation in these areas causes pain and stiffness in and around the spine. The treatment of ankylosing spondylitis typically involves the use of medications to reduce inflammation and/or suppress immunity to stop progression of the disease, physical therapy, and exercise. Nucoxia contains etoricoxib which is used to relieve pain and inflammation. The prognosis for patients with ankylosing spondylitis is very much dependent upon the location and severity of its manifestations. The prognosis is best for those who maintain close monitoring with the treating doctors and who incorporate physical activities designed to maintain mobility.  If he is smoking its better quit smoking. Oral or injectable corticosteroids (cortisone) are potent anti-inflammatory agents and can effectively control spondylitis and other inflammations in the body, but can't be used for longer time.

A number of things can cause lymph nodes to become enlarged, but in the vast majority of the time, the cause is an infection. Other causes can be malignancy, but this is much rarer. If the lymph node is tender, it makes malignancy much more unlikely. I'd take ibuprofen and use warm compresses on the affected area. If the lymph node gets smaller, I wouldn't worry about it at all. If it continues to be enlarged, hardened and painless, then I would seek out an ultrasound. Again, I'd give it a week after your other symptoms resolve before I'd start to worry.

When I went to see a Dr, she removed the cap along with which the tooth part came out.Dr. has suggested me 2 options :1) Have an implant of metal by removing the root.2) Have a bridge by cutting the left-adjacent natural tooth and removing the cap of right-adjacent root-canaled tooth.Which one would be better option to prevent food lodgment? 1 or 2?Would you suggest 3) a replacement of cap? or 4) leave the root-canaled tooth without a cap", "output": "Hello, I went through your query. If more than 75% of tooth structure is lost then placing a crown (cap) on the broken tooth is not recommended. Otherwise, there is a possibility of placing a Post and Core on the tooth. That has to be decided by your dentist based on the condition of the tooth. Also, I would not recommend leave the broken tooth without a crown. And between dental implants and bridge, I would recommend a Dental implant, if the condition of the bone is sound, because it does not involve preparation (cutting) of the adjacent teeth.

Her heart is functioning at 25%, she is having problems breathing.  My mom was just admitted to the hospital due to fluid in her lungs.  What are her chances of getting better?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, this does not carry good prognosis in your mothers case. She is having low heart pumping (25%) and chronic kidney disease (dialysis dependent). So her heart and kidneys are almost non-functioning. When these two organs fail in their work, fluid tend to accumulate in the body. This is the reason why she is having fluid in the lungs. This also causes breathlessness. So breathlessness and fluid in the lungs suggest further deterioration in heart and kidney functions. And hence this carries poor prognosis. Chances of getting better are very, very less. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."}

I can understand your concern. You had chronic mold exposure. This can lead to bronchitis (inflammation of airways). Bronchitis causes bronchospasm and this in turn causes cough, expectoration, chest tightness, breathing difficulty etc. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

On the 3rd day when we were in hospital her bilirubin came as 10 and doctors gave us phototherapy . When the Bilirubin came to 6 we got discharged. We were told to get the bilirubin check again after 2 days. We did so and the bilirubin was reported as 14. This was the 6th day and we went to the docs clinic. The doctor said that this is the peak day for bilirubin hence no need to worry . he recommended the bilirubin to be checked again after 36 hours. if it increases then admit here in hospital again. we did so and after 36 hours the bilirub was reported as 26. This was very alarming. We rushed to the hospital after we got the report and they addmitted her in emergency and gave her triple photo light . in 2 hours the bilirubin came to 22 else they were ready for a blood transfusion. Then we remained in hospital 2 more days till the bilirubin came to 8. After that it was 5.9 and we got over with Jaundice. Now doctors are saying that since the bilirubin went so high from 14 to 26 in 36 hours and it was a rare case from them ( i dont know if they are saying the truth) hence they recommend a BERA hearing test. Should i go for it. ? they just want to be safe that the baby didnt got any hearing loss since they consider 26 bilirubin as high", "output": "Brief... if high bilirubin level is physiological then phototherapy or blood exchange (transfusion) is the best treatment. Detailed answer. There can be many causes of high bilirubin level, which are treated accordingly. For example.if there is jaundice within first 24 hrs of birth, it is almost always pathological like because of AGO incompatibility; hereditary He diseases or hereditary biliary sclerosis etc. If jaundice is after 24 hrs of birth, it can be because of breast milk or physiological as liver enzymes are not mature enough to metabolize etc. Well first from the history of your child, it seems that she has been suffering from physiological (normal) jaundice, which can be treated with phototherapy and exchange transfusion. But if bilirubin level is above 20 it can effect brain so the sensory hearing loss and which can be permanent and non-treatable, so better to be on safe side, hearing test should be done, once child is stable.

After seeing my chest x-ray the physician suspected about my health and told me that I may be suffering from tuberculosis (TB). But there was not clear sympton of TB in my health.After one year in July 2011 I started to sneezing and coughing with light fever. I got in mind the physicians doubt of last year.So I got again chest x ray and got no sympton of TB and started to take some medicine prescribed by the physician.

Please help me.", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. I have gone through the x-ray report you have mentioned. Prominent bronchovascular markings and prominent hill are commonly seen with asthma. You are also having sneezing and coughing. So possibility of allergic asthma is more in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of asthma is based on severity only. You will need inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Oral combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti-allergic (montelukast) is also beneficial in your case. Don't worry, you will be alright. No need to worry about tuberculosis. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."}

Without wasting time, as you told she had a fall, and post that only this blackness on her forehead though it is a month-old injury. I think she had a fall and internal bleeding, that is the reason of the black spot and swelling. Usually any swelling should come by a maximum of week or so. Human body is a self medicine for itself, so body removes the excess waste from the excretory system. Also, I am unsure if you have met a physician that day. If not I will recommend you to meet one and get checked. Also, I am not sure, where at this age she is mobile or no because continuous lying down can also lead to pressure sore at this age. As we age the human body loses its capacity to quick healing. Just on a safer note I recommend visiting a physician and get checked once. If all turns out fine then you can help her by just requesting a physical therapy services at the door step.

I broke a bone in my heal 6 years ago.", "output": "Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. As your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, I suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. Also. When there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. As you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain. As I feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. Since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. So before it gets more on future you can get an MRI of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. In my clinical experience I see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with Nerve impingement diagnosis. So, from past couple of years I have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the Neurological pain, so now I deal with first an MRI of spine and core stability. Results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "}

Between two mont I check my blood two time it show the same lymphocytes high then normal. My Docter said you don t have any complain. So it s okay. But this happen after I my saw my docter, now I m worried.", "output": "Hello, I will add Chat Doctor.  One of the causes could be a condition called bronchitis which is a type of inflammation of the lining of our large breathing tube or bronchus. This condition is usually viral and may show slightly higher lymphocytes on your blood count. Blood in the sputum or spit may also arise from the inflammation of the lining of the nose. These conditions are not serious and resolves. However, one should also know that blood in the sputum can arise from tuberculosis or cancer type diseases also which from your description does not appear to be the cause. However, my advice is that you should get a test called peripheral blood smear done. You must also obtain your test report on absolute lymphocyte count. Persistently raised lymphocyte count has to be investigated with additional tests such as flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy. At the moment bone marrow biopsy is not necessary, but you must get a peripheral blood smear examination done by a pathologist along with an absolute lymphocyte count done. You may also feel for any lumps in your neck and armpit. If there are any you must get investigated by a physician promptly. I presume that your platelet count is OK because low platelets can cause bleeding. Overall my opinion is that your blood in the sputum may be a temporary phenomenon as you recover from a viral or allergy related illness, but it is important to also get some investigations done. Therefore, please get the following investigations:Peripheral blood smear with absolute lymphocyte countSputum examination with cytologyChest XRayPlease feel free to clarify your test results also Best regards"}

I was diagnosed with hashimoto thyroiditist. my tsh level have been in the normal range but my antibody levels are alway high 400-500 range. my endocrinologist said i can not do anything about the antibody level and to not be concerned but i have researched that you can be on a low dose thyroid medicine to decrease the level. i just want to do everything i can to have a heathly baby and pregnancy if i do become pregnant", "output": "Hi I think you should not worry about your antibody level if your thyroid profile is normal. What we can do is to test your baby for a thyroid profile just after birth and then if any treatment is required it can be given. You can try for pregnancy. Just go for an ultrasound to see the follicles count. If everything is normal you can try naturally for 6 months before taking any medical support. Hope I have answered your question.

The initial management of Spondylolisthesis is always conservative by the following measures -- Avoid excessive forward bending activities as it will worsen the disc protrusion as well as further forward slipping of the vertebra. If you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Avoid lifting heavy weights as it imparts more strain on your back-Maintain optimum body weight, if you are obese. A faster progression of listless and higher chances of worsening are very common in obese individuals.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles and prevent further progression of the listless.- Use analgesic and muscle relaxants as needed. If you fail to improve with the above measures or if your symptoms are worsening in due course of time, then you may need a surgical fixation. Hope this information is helpful. Good day"}

I also have rt thigh pain and rt. abdomen pain/soreness heat does provide relief. with increased activity my thigh and rt. hip pain increase causing me to limp. My doctor recently treated me with methylpredisolone tablets 4 mg. for a week that really helps with the pain and soreness, After the medications was gone the pain and soreness started to come back. I hope that you can help me to understand what is going on. Thank you.", "output": "avascular necrosis is revascularization of femoral head (loss in blood supply), this causes bone part to become necroses (dead) and becomes susceptible to fracture collapse eventually, when partially necroses, it is very painful on weight-bearing or walking. X-ray shows it as denser area than surrounding or adjacent bone. Once the blood supply is impaired, complete necrosis follows in 6 months to 2 years. So salvage operations are done with prosthetic implants or weight shifting surgery. I hope your doctor has confirmed if it is indeed avascular necrosis. Arthritis is different, in hip, it doesn't lead to avascular necrosis but destruction of joint surfaces and reshaping of joint in later stages. We must be clear whether it is arthritis only or avascular necrosis as treatment varies.It's best to leave it to your orthopedic or hip surgeon to decide diagnosis and treatment. Yes, as you are advised physical therapy it maybe just arthritis, which is more readily manageable conservatively, unlike avascular necrosis which requires surgery more frequently best wishes"}

I had severe pain which is lessening but  I sometimes get a sharp pain when sitting down or standing up. It was diagnosed as a contusion but there is no bruise mark.  X-rays did not show any breaks. I try to walk around a little bit and take 600 mg ibuprofen every 4 hours.  Why no bruise mark if it is a contusion, how much longer until pain goes completely away and should I use any other type of treatment? I use an ice pack every few hours.  Thanks.", "output": "Hi there, Thanks for writing in. Initial 24-48 hours after any injury, it is best to use an ice pack intermittently. However, now the injury is almost a week old, in which case hot fomentation would be ideal. Apply a small quantity of pain relief gel like voting(diclofenac gel) to the affected region of the back. Do not massage or rub the gel too much. Just apply it lightly. After half an hour or so apply a hot water bag/ hot fomentation to the affected area. Do the above at least 3 times a day. Reduce the oral intake of ibuprofen gradually. Too much of this pain relief medication can cause gastritis. Hopefully you should be completely okay in another week or so. If the pain persists or increases in intensity, please visit your physician at the earliest... Hope this helps."}

An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring is necessary to rule in/out a possible cardiac arrhythmia.

But in general several studies revealed that there is 65-80% success rate of angioplasty in post-CABG (Bypass) patients. When these patients were followed over a period of next 30 months then about 70% of them were pain-free and had an improvement in angina. However, around 27% required repeat angioplasty with about 80% success rate while 15-20% were complicated by re-infarction and only 4-6% with cardiac death. In my opinion proceed with angiography to help determine the extent of blockage and to decide about the options available. Make sure the medications' compliance post-procedure as this is crucial. Stay blessed."}

A second opinion from another Oncologist says that at this late point it is best to leave the patient untreated.  Need your advise. Also, if any treatment can be provided to avoid pain and suffering, i would like to know about the options", "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Sometimes it can get difficult on deciding the treatment of a patient having cancer with metastasis like your father. Chemotherapy can prolong survival in TCC with metastasis. It is important to know accurate details of the tumor in bladder and metastasis location. If the patient is asymptomatic then it is possible to further extend his survival by giving chemotherapy. Chemotherapy agents that have shown activity in metastatic bladder cancer include paclitaxel, docetaxel, ifosfamide, gallium nitrate, and gemcitabine and these are promising as they extend the survival of the patient even with metastasis. I suggest you discuss in detail with the second oncologist and then take an informed decision. Pain relief is an important part in treating cancers and this assumes a greater significance in those with metastasis. Pain relief is given using a step approach and that much of pain relief is given which can allow the patient to stay in comfort. Pain relievers are usually opioids and controlled medications."}

Normally liver clears almost all the ammonia by converting it into glut amine and urea preventing entry into the systemic circulation. In advance liver disease or cirrhosis, the level of blood ammonia increases due to impaired liver function and shunting of blood around the liver. In addition, muscle wasting may increase ammonia level since muscle is also an important site for ammonia removal. So, when the liver is damaged, excess of ammonia can build up in the bloodstream and affect the function of the nervous system resulting in hepatic encephalopathy. So, excess of ammonia enters into systemic (blood) circulation causing The excess level of ammonia can be reduced by giving laxative (Lactulose) to prevent bacteria in the intestines from creating ammonia and by certain antibiotics such as Aureomycin or Rifaximin which kill the bacteria which produce ammonia in the gut.

One of the answers on your website said to apply deluted bleach - how much bleach to how much water? We are trying to get an appointment with our doctor to confirm that it is ringworm and also what they suggest to do for it. We realize it is contagious.", "output": "First you have to confirm it is ring worm because unless we have proper diagnosis there no any use of unnecessary treatment. So my opinion is that take appointment of doctor on priority basis & confirm the thing is ringworm. If it is ringworm then it is transferred to other person only by intimate contact & for getting infected patient must be susceptible. It is not transferred by airborne route & if proper hygienic precautions are taken. If the ring worm is confirmed only topical therapy (local application) will not be sufficient & you should have to take oral antifungal such as Terminating plus local antifungal application such as itraconazole. (for detail therapy consult your dermatologist) My advice is that do not use bleach as it may not be helpful in ringworm infestation instead use one of the above said antifungal cream."}

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. I would like to ask you about your symptoms in great detail, like - what are the activities that precipitate itching & rashes, whether they occur without any activity as well, whether you have any other medical conditions, whether you are taking any other medicines on regular basis, whether you have any other allergies, etc. etc. However, from your history, I would first think of what we call \"Cholinergic urticaria\". It is not exactly due to \"allergy\", rather it is due to some physical factors which causes rashes and itching. Were I treating you, I would suggest you as follows:1. Please avoid exercises and activities causing excessive sweating, if possible.2. Please avoid bathing in hot water, sauna baths, exposure to hot temperatures, etc. However, if any of these does not cause you symptoms, you can continue with it.3. I would suggest you to avoid hot beverages, alcohol and hot-spicy foods as much as possible.4. If you are having mental/emotional stress, I would suggest you regular meditation and stress reduction techniques as it also can be aggravating your symptoms.5. If you are not comfortable with cetirizine, I would personally suggest you to take ketotifen, which works better for these types of urticaria.6. Please do not scratch when you itch, it will only aggravate itching. You can apply lotion on itchy areas. An important thing I want to mention here is please do not think of \"addiction\" of antihistamines. These types of urticaria usually last for several years. So as long as you have symptoms, you need to take antihistamines like cetirizine. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Thank you & Regards."}

Thanks :))", "output": "Hello. Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor Since you seem to have a generalized involvement with psoriasis; this type of involvement is also known as erythrodermic psoriasis Or unstable psoriasis. This type of psoriasis involvement is associated with thermoregulatory as well as metabolic complications as a result of the lack of normal temperature regulatory functions of the skin as well as loss of proteins, and fluids from the skin. In general unstable forms of psoriasis like erythrodermic, pustular psoriasis is managed conservatively with topical emollients and Oral / Systemic Immunosuppressive like Methotrexate, Cyclosporin etc. Before starting on PVA, patients skin is tested for the tolerable effective dose of PVA, known as MED (minimal erythema dose). The starting dose of PVA is then calculated as 75% of MED. However, if all the skin is already red, there cannot be an accurate determination of MED. Therefore, if inadvertent higher doses of PVA are given in erythrodermic psoriasis without calculating MED, PVA can further irritate the skin and therefore is not the first choice amongst dermatologist in unstable psoriasis. Nevertheless, PVA can be given in low doses along with other systemic treatment like methotrexate, cyclosporin etc. even in erythrodermic psoriasis. Regards"}

I have gained a stone in weight and yet my bump at the moment is only small. I am having trouble functioning and am desperate for help.", "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. I am sorry that your breasts have developed such a painful condition. You are correct that you may have breast hypertrophy, which is abnormal growth of the breasts, due to the hormones of pregnancy. Gigantomastia describes breasts that increase in size by 2.5 kg or greater. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments for breast hypertrophy, especially during pregnancy. Hormonal medications really do not work, and elective surgery is not recommended until at least a year after the baby is born, as sometimes the size of the breast does go down on its own. In the meantime, ice packs and supportive, stretch bras, even when you sleep, can help with the discomfort. Limiting your overall weight gain will also help slow down breast growth, as a significant portion of breast tissue is fat. Applying lots of lotion and emollients to the skin will help reduce stretch marks. I am sorry that there is no immediate treatment for your condition, but your breasts may slow in growth as the pregnancy progresses. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"}

They are A, B, C, D, E and G. All cause the liver to become inflamed, which interferes with its ability to function normally. All of these viruses cause Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in the acute phase. These return to normal as the liver recovers and the time range is 2 weeks to 3 months normally. It may be more in the case of weaker/ aged individuals. Depending on which virus causes the hepatitis the blood test report will vary. Hepatitis A (causes acute viral hepatitis-Jaundice) is usually a self limiting disease which resolves without any medication. Diet and rest are the important parts of treating it. The antibody (HAD antibody) is not a routinely done test in India. If the antibody test is done, it can show a positive result for up to a period of about 6 months.

The treatment of cervical stenosis and myelopathy (spinal cord involvement) depends on signs and symptoms in addition to MRI. It would have been helpful to know the current symptoms. However, it is difficult to imagine having no symptoms with such an advanced stenosis picture. For the findings you have described unfortunately medicines won't help. When symptoms are progressive surgery is the only solution. Moreover, earlier the surgery better would be the outcome. The problem of cervical myelopathy is always progressive. Finding of myelomalacia indicates some damage to spinal cord has already occurred, and the cord must be decompressed surgically as early as possible to prevent further worsening. Also, risk of getting weakness in arms and legs is high even with a trivial fall or trauma to neck. Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

But appearance of lumps on your shins raises obviously whether you are noticing what we call as herald sign of underlying systemic or autoimmune disease. You should recognize a fact that skin is eminently involved in such processes as most characteristic presentations.

When I have used prednisone in the past, I usually was given lower doses and had to taper off. I am a bit concerned because of the high dose level and sudden stop at the end of five days. Thanks you...", "output": "Hi. Oral prednisone is very useful in allergies as it ceases the inflammatory response to the allergen almost instantaneously. It is necessary to taper steroids only if they have been taken for more than 14 days since that is the duration required by the body to start getting dependent on an external source of steroid (Hypothalami pituitary axis). A 5-day course of steroid can be stopped abruptly without any foreseeable complications. Do keep in mind that high doses of prednisone may affect your vision so do see your physician who started you on these if you develop blurring of vision or changes in color. High steroid doses may also make you vulnerable to infections so try to avoid anything that exposes you to a source of infection. A 5-day course of steroids is usually nothing to be concerned about.

I do not believe your teeth have been affected by your exposure. You are suffering from a severe reaction that has caused a great deal of inflammation. This may affect the soft tissue inside you mouth if exposed to any oils of these plants. Simply, inflamed tissue can equal sensitive teeth. Pain medication may help while the amount of inflammation is great. First, make sure you are not getting continued exposure to these plants and oils? Change your toothbrush and anything you may have touched which may carry the oil. There are some endocrine gels or rinses that you could try for your mouth. Switch to a toothpaste for sensitive teeth. These have a chemical that blocks the tubules on the roots of your teeth to reduce sensitivity. Avoid an acidic diet. I believe there is a relationship between these plants and some foods: mangos and cashews. You need to give this time to heal. Rashes can easily last two weeks. Return to your doctor if you feel your symptoms are getting worse to see if you need more medication. Ben Chat Doctor.  Topical solutions for your skin are available that can help you reduce the itchy feeling. I hope you will find some of these suggestions useful, and I wish you a quicker recovery.

I had a marina coil in place at the time of my transplant and recently had it changed to a new one. I have had a vaginal irritation and discharge ever since. My doctors have swabbed me twice and cannot identify the reason for the discharge and irritation, could this be caused by the marina?", "output": "Hello, Thanks for writing in. The fact that you had marina coil earlier too and got it replaced rules out any adverse reaction to the coil itself. You could also get an ultrasound scan to be sure that the coil is in place. Since you have had kidney transplant, your immunity may be little weaker than in normal individuals. Fungal infections are not picked up on routine sexually transmitted infection tests. This can result in fungal infection in your vagina which is causing the irritation. I suggest you apply some antifungal medication as suggested by your gynecologist. Hope this helps."}

ECG and stress tests all clear.Thank you", "output": "Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Well, after the EKG and stress tests came back normal, we can exclude, with the highest probability, a rhythm or conduction disturbance which could be innate. It is important to be stressed that heart rate tends to increase whenever any human being is engaging in physical activity - it is normal to go up to 200 beats per minute in your daughters case, or is undergoing to a state with psychological stress. If that is so, then there is nothing to worry about. Also, the pain originating in the right part of the chest and then radiating to the right arm is not linked with the palpitations, and very rarely, with any heart condition. My opinion is that repeated palpitations generate certain amounts of anxiety and the anxiety produces really-felt symptoms by the subject complaining about them, but with no organic or disease-based origin.

In my opinion the December 1st might be considered as your last menstrual period (LMP). Usually the age of pregnancy need to be calculated basing on the LMP. For it the last 3 menstrual cycles should be regular. But as you had miscarriage last time and bleeding was prolonged ultrasound might be helpful. Ultrasound taken within 1st trimester i.e., within 12 weeks of pregnancy helps in accurate estimation of age of pregnancy, the well-being of concepts and also for the accurate dating of pregnancy. So I suggest you to go for ultrasound. And also rule out any thyroid abnormalities, progesterone insufficiency, any genetic anomalies etc. which are the causes of first trimester miscarriage.

I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, molds, pollen, insect proteins, animal dander (if you have pet), etc. As you have morning symptoms more often, I would first think of indoor allergens like house dust mites, molds and insect proteins. This will help you identify the substance causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.2. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long duration. Please note that Immunotherapy takes time to become most effective. It gradually reduces your requirement of medications.3. For symptom relief, I would suggest you combination of montelukast and levocetirizine which will reduce your allergy symptoms.4. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.

Im currently living on the streets because my house burned down, but im asking this question from a library computer.  i dont want to die! help me!", "output": "Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. Symptoms you are experiencing like abdominal pain and loss of appetite could be associated with jaundice, as you are suspecting. However, clinically it needs to be detected by examination of sclera in daylight. Jaundice causes yellowish discoloration of skin and mucosa due to increased bilirubin levels in serum. Due to this, during the illness, you also pass high colored urine. Once suspected, jaundice needs to be proved at least by laboratory test called as Liver function test. It is mainly diagnosed by Total and Direct bilirubin levels along with enzyme levels in serum. Hence, you need to be clinically evaluated by Physician first followed by Liver function test done in the laboratory for confirmation. Based on the results, you would be appropriately treated. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."}

Inflammation of the fascia, etc this are just few to mention. But to take care at home you need to first do hot water fermentation as it will improve the blood supply and dilate the pain from there. Post doing Hot water fermentation you can do some exercises for the feet like - picking the marbles from the floor with toes, picking the bits of paper, performing ankle toe movements as well.

He was not having trouble breathing and had no chest pains. The pediatrician told us to go the the ER. They did an EKG, his oxygen level was 99, they did a chest xray and a CT. They could find nothing wrong. They said his white blood cell count was slightly elevated. The coloration faded in about an hour. It returned an hour later but not as dark. The next day it happened several times but never as dark as the first time it happened. They are sending us to a cardiologist. I am looking for some answers as to what could be wrong with him.", "output": "The bluish coloration as you have described may occur when there is deoxygenated blood -that is blood with less oxygen in it. This condition in medical terms is called CYANOSIS (cyan meaning bluish). Since our heart is the pump that supplies us with oxygenated blood, the first step in a child with cyanosis would be to get the heart checked. Your doctor has correctly referred you to a cardiologist as this is the first step. Certain heart problems require a cardiologists' expertise. They would probably do a test called Echocardiogram to get a better view of the detailed working of the chambers, valves etc. of the heart.  Not all cardiac diseases present with chest pain or breathing problems. Some have mild symptoms and some do not have any symptoms. The elevation of the white blood cell count since it is marginal may or may not be significant. Medical care is very advanced in the 21st century & there is a solution for almost all problems.

It feels as if the pain has been getting worse over the past 2 weeks. Im just curious what it could possibly be.", "output": "Hi, Thank you for providing the brief history of you. Also, a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. As, you have pain in the posterior aspect of the chest cage, it could be a muscle spasm, since due to performing some physical activity, this could have occurred. Since you did not mention anything about the cold, cough etc., I do not think it will be a lung pathology. So, looks more of a muscular pain, which needs an attention. Undergoing physical therapy assessment and post that, Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should reduce your pain. As, pain level reduces, the therapist will teach the exercises.

The inflammation is quite small at the moment but i can feel it with my tongue when i talk. I m a non- smoking 25 year old male. I had been feeling quite considerably stressed for the last 3 days from work. What do you think this may be?", "output": "Hi, Thanks for posting your query at Chat Doctor. First, I would like you to mention, stress usually does not cause inflammation in the region of the incisive papilla. After reading your symptoms I feel that you may have injured/scraped that region due to something hard in your food. If you keep touching the area with either your tongue or your finger, it can lead to interruption in healing resulting in inflammation and pain on probing. I would recommend you to apply any good topical anesthetic ointment in the area 2-3 times/day. Do not aggregate the lesion by touching it. It should resolve in a day or two. If the problem does not resolve, you should visit a dentist for oral examination. Hope you feel better soon. Regards"}

I hit the front of my right thigh hard. All the bruising went away but my right leg is still swollen. My thigh is numb and burns. It also feels kinda hard?", "output": "Hi, Thank you providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned you met an accident and have injured 5 ribs, and you have on bruising over your thigh and swelling of right leg. Since you mentioned you have numbness and burning sensation over the right thigh it could be healing of the soft tissue of the skin. But to ask, have you taken any x-ray or MRI of the lumbar spine. As usually in RTA one shouldn't ignore spine. Any injury to spine is initially undetected and later gives symptoms. So I will recommend taking that.Also, to advice you, is to perform regular breathing exercises. There are types of it and a physical therapist can teach you.- Deep breathing- Purse lip breathing-Costal Breathing-Abdominal breathing.- Coughing and Huffington - perform all exercises by placing the hand over the injured ribs. As it will restrict the mobility of the ribs and will not interfere in healing.Also, this breathing exercises will help you gain strength in the muscles of respiration and also the abdominal muscles. Post this kindly do some simple upper limb and lower limb exercises to keep the joint mobility maintained and also the muscle property. Muscles should not go into wasting. Also you need to keep the right leg over the pillow when you are lying down to remove the metabolic waste. Due to metabolic waste the healing can be delayed to its better to focus on each corner. Later on once Your ribs turns out to be good, slowly progress to core stability and spine stretching so in future you will have a good and strong spine. As you must have noticed about the professional riders they all have a good abs, it is because to have a strong spine. Spine is the important segment of the human body which connects the upper and lower half of the body. Later on you will be focussing on lower limb strengthening as the best, so the weaker muscle becomes strong, and you have a strong regain. Also, if possible kindly take an MRI just to have a doubt clear that the spine is safe. The symptoms of burning and numbness can be because of it, so for ruling out this one doubt its on a safer side to get it done. I hope to see you soon with your motorcycle again. With the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery regards"}

The soreness over the gum and the alveolar ridge could be an ulcer secondary to the use of tobacco. It can be a leukoplakia or erythroplakia or ulcerative lesion.

Thanking You Reeta Sachdev", "output": "Hello Ms Re eta, Probably the brain damage following the head injury was too much and so your father has not recovered. Unconsciousness for 20 days following an injury is very long and indicates poor chances of functional recovery. The doctor must have assessed the brain functions by means of examination before communicating to you that it is not functioning properly. The decision to take him home remains with you. There are no medications which can really improve brain function in such situations. Any recovery that occurs is due to the healing of the injury to the brain on its own.

But before coming to that diagnosis, I would want to evaluate your heart and vascular function. I would like to know if you are diabetic, hypertensive, smoking, under constant emotional stress. The reason I would want to know this is that these are risk factors to develop heart disease later, and so they are to be treated now. An ECG may be done though it is most likely that you would have a normal one, but it is better to confirm it. Having a family history of heart disease DOES NOT make you 100% likely to get heart disease. It is possible that you may never get it too.

The season starts now... so should I stay off it 4 weeks and get it healed, or should i get through the whole basketball season with the stress fracture and then address it later?", "output": "Hi, It will not cause any problem once it is healed. Since the stress fracture has involved the weight-bearing bones of your foot (heel) it takes from 6 to 8 weeks for such a fracture to heal. Returning to basketball season too soon can put you at risk for larger, harder-to-heal stress fractures and an even longer downtime. Re-injury could lead to chronic problems and the stress fracture might never heal properly. Once your pain has subsided, your doctor may confirm that the stress fracture has healed by taking X-rays or a CT scan then only you will be allowed to join your activity slowly. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "}

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. But don't worry.I'll try to explain you something and give you some advises. You might experience fast, and strong heart beats for different reasons. It may be a simple sinus tachycardia. This mean that your heart beats over 100 beats for minute. Its normal range in resting situation is between 60-100 beat for minute. This might happen from different reasons from simple emotional stores to different pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. You may feel strong heart beats because of extrasistoles.These is electrical impulses that generates from different parts of the heart different from that of a normal sinus rhythm. This houses an ectopic, escaped beat and you feel like a beat is skipping, and the other one is stronger causing difficulties in breathing fully and sometimes a cough. The extrasistolic beats might happen for the same reasons as sinus tachycardia. Sometimes in young ages or in stressed periods these are quite normal, and they come ang go. But if your heart beats very fast suddenly and in a chaotic, irregular way it might be what we call an atrial fibrillation. This is an arrhythmia when the heart doesn't beat in a normal sinus rhythm. You might experience paroxysmal episodes when your heart jumps from normal rhythm to fibrillation and vise- versa. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend you to make some simple examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia or hypothyroidism, an electrocardiogram,echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring for 24-48 hours. This will tell as your rhythm tendency. You have nothing to worry, but I will recommend this check up if these symptoms begin to interfere with your normal healthy live. At mean time avoid coffee and caffeine products because they rise your heart frequency or extra systoles. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards."}

I generally have excess blood and mucus in it, and sometimes all that comes out is pure mucus with blood mixed in. Usually very fresh bright red blood. Today I ve had it really bad and actually had stool that looked extremely dark, almost black and had a watery consistency. My surgeon told me to take some extra fiber but it doesn t seem to be working. I haven t had any pain since the gallbladder was removed but during the time when I had the problem with my gallbladder I lost about fifteen pounds due to nausea so I did not want to eat anything, not sure if its relevant. I ve tried to avoid things like dairy and meat as they have caused some problems for me. Do you have any idea what it could mean?", "output": "Dear sir, it could mean many things, but I think that there shouldn't be any relation between your gallbladder removal and this symptom. It sounds for me more like typical colon disorder; IBD, Crohn or ulcers colitis, infective colitis etc. The best way to rule it out is to do colonoscopy. After that you can plan further tests. Blood in stool can also be serious sign of some benign(polyps, haemorrhoids, fissuea) as well as malignant diseases so don't be very concerned but do colonoscopy definitely. Wish you good health,"}

This past year, I have had bronchitis or some other kind of lung infection 5 times, each time worse than the last. the cough I get with these infections will last weeks after other symptoms go away, along with coughing up mucus. I just completed a round of Biaxin to treat my latest infection, but with this infection came fevers, headaches, and a lot of shortness of breath and chest pain, all which are still lingering. My mom insists on sticking with my pediatrician to figure out what is going on with me, but I feel there is only so much they can do. I had a chest scan and a blood test for CBC, sed rate, and allergies. everything came back normal. along with the chest pain, shortness of breath, occasional fevers, headaches and bark-like cough, sometimes producing mucus, I have had some lower back pain, and have been overly sensitive, like crying super easily, like during a tv show happy or sad moment or a minor issue, which I did not normally used to do. I am generally happy overall and enjoy my life, friends, and job, so it is not depression or anything like that. The only medication I take is birth control and now an inhaler to try and help the labored breathing. I also bruise super easily, sometimes out of no where. I had a few tests done at a hematologist a few months ago, but nothing conclusive came from it, I am not sure if that is relevant. Does anyone know what could possibly be going on with me? Thanks!", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of either bronchitis or Pulmonary embolism is more. Birth control pills can cause Pulmonary embolism. So in my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test) 2. CT Pulmonary Angiography. PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need additional inhaled bronchodilators and oral bronchodilators also.  CT Pulmonary Angiography is needed to rule out Pulmonary embolism. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

MRI showed S1 compression- but a neurologist says it has nothing to do with my genital area. I found on your website a very similar cause- and the doctor said it s NERVE COMPRESSION. my question is: how long you can have it before it s too late for surgery? can S1 affects genital area? what specialist I should see about it? (Neurologist said : find a good PM&R doctor) When the numbness goes away? how can I know the nerve is not damaged? here are my MRI results Please HELP !!! Findings: Mild disc desiccation consistent with degenerative disc disease is noted within the lumbar spine. At L1-L2 and L2-L3 no neurocompressive changes are identified. At L3-L4 there is annular disc bulging with flattening along the ventral margin of the thecal sac. No resultant central or foraminal stenosis is seen. At L4-L5 there is annular disk bulge with impression on the thecal sac. Disk material causes encroachment within the inferior left neural foramen. At L5-S1 there is central and left paracentral disc herniation with impingement and displacement on the left S1 nerve root in its lateral recess. More diffuse disc bulging also cause encroachment within the bilateral neural foramina. Degenerative endplate changes are seen at the L5-S1 level. The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal height and narrow signal characteristics. The conus medullaris is at the L1 level and displays normal morphology. IMPRESSION Central and left paracentral disc herniation L5-S1 with impingement upon the left S1 nerve root. This is superimposed on more diffuse disc bulging. Degenerative endplate changes at this level is also noted. Annular disc bulging at L4-L5 with impression on the thecal sac. Annular disc bulging is also noted L3-L4.", "output": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, The intervertebral discs are cartilaginous structures present between vertebrae. The disc acts as lubricant for smooth motion of the vertebral bodies during movement of the spine. At times the disc starts bulging out from its normal position. The bulging disc starts impinging nerve roots which emanate from the spinal cord. The nerve emanate through small foramina in the vertebral bodies. These foramina are intact in your case. In your case, discs are bulging at the level of L4-L5 and L5-S1. Due to the compression, the area supplied by these nerves are affected. This is responsible for the pain and numbness in the foot region. The S1 nerve does not supply the genital region. The treatment for this condition is complete bed rest. If the condition does not improve on bed rest, surgical measures may be required. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "}

From your description, it seems you are having atrophic scars due to chickenpoxScars are pretty challenging to treat and treatment comes with variable results. More importantly the fact is no topical medications are going to help in removing scars. Only retinoid or glycolic acid based creams can help to some extent, but the results are very subtle and unpredictable and works for very mild scars only. Therefore, I would suggest you to go for laser therapy (Fractional Co2 laser, Non-ablative RF etc.) as it has the best results of all other treatment modalities. Moreover, if additionally treated with dermaroller or 100%TCA peel (CROSS technique), pretty appreciable results can be achieved. Hope this will take care of your query.

Alpha motor neurons are activated before gamma motor neurons. c. Alpha and gamma motor neurons are activated at the same time. d. During light activity, gamma motor neurons are activated first; during heavy activity, alpha motor neurons are activated first. e. Gamma motor neurons are activated before alpha motor neurons.", "output": "Answer e) is correct. During active stretch excitation of gamma efferent neutrons of anterior gray column of spinal cord produces contraction of polar regions of the intro fugal fibers and there by not contractile equatorial regions of nuclear bag and chain fibers are actively stretched. This results in excitation of alpha motor neurons through the monosynaptic loop of stretch reflex consequently the extra fugal fibers of the corresponding muscle are contracted until it shortens to equal with the degree of contraction of muscle spindle. This method of contraction of skeletal muscle maintains its residual length. The alpha and gamma motor neurons are excited simultaneously by the pyramidal tract, the alpha neurons being the fast conductors initiate muscle contraction without limit of shortening and the gamma neurons through the reflex loop maintain muscle contraction with desired length."}

You should visit a stem cell therapy center and meet the doctor first and resolve all the doubts before you go ahead with it. You should note that the same thing applies to ch elation therapy for autism. Beware of money-making rackets! Do your own research before submitting your son to an experiment which is likely very expensive. Remember also that autism tends to reduce as the child grows older.

Though your symptoms are suggestive of reflux, it would be prudent to visit your physician and get an ECG(or an EKG) done to rule out a problem in the heart. Reducing your stress levels, having food at proper time, and avoiding spicy foods and tea and coffee and too many chocolates, avoiding lying down just after eating food, having dinner about 2 hours before you go to sleep may all help to reduce your reflux symptoms. Medicines are available to effectively suppress reflux, and you may discuss with your physician regarding the same.

Let me try to help you I understand that your wife continues to have a lot of swelling after the last surgery which was done in 15 April 2014After a stroke, the brain swells and this increases the pressure inside the skull. This increased pressure decreases the blood circulation. So we have to reduce the pressure immediately. For this the surgeon take a part of the skull so that the brain is able to swell freely. Once the swelling of the brain reduces, the part of the skull can be replaced. Or instead of the part of skull, a titanium mesh can be kept Now How long it takes for the swollen brain to Come back to normal size ? It varies from individual to individual For Some, it returns within 2 months. For some, it may take more than 2 years.

There is very less possibility that wisdom tooth removal pain lasts for this long unless it is a traumatic extraction. I would also like to point out that the healing time varies with every person.

Next the bone kind of thing and tonsil kind of thing that popped out could be the healing tissue as I've stated before. All these might have resulted in an opening rather communication between his mouth and nose, the reason for his difficulty in blowing his nose. This can be corrected by a small surgical procedure(if required, which has to be decided by your treating dentist/oral surgeon)Till then avoid vigorous gargling, blowing nose, sucking and sneezing.

Low dose oxygen should be given continuously for at least 16-18 hours a day. This is the best treatment. 2. Start perfinodone. It is the only available and US FDA approved anti-fibrotic agent. It reduces rate of fibrosis. 3. N acetyl cysteine is having excellent antioxidant, bucolic and expectorant properties. And hence it is beneficial in IPF. 4.

Now, you could try analgesics such as diclofenac. If symptoms persist, you could see a doctor and get MRI Lumbar spine done. I hope this is helpful to you.

And i still struggle when swallowing. And for some readon the past three days my molars have been hurting. Its the pain/pressure you feel during a braces tightening. I also see whiteish stuff on all four wisdom extracted sights. My tongue is also stikl numb on one side. Is there something i should worry about", "output": "Hi. Thanks for the query. Difficulty or soreness during swallowing post wisdom tooth removal can be most probably due to inflammation in throat as wisdom tooth extraction can cause inflammation in soft tissues in the extraction site and due to proximity of throat there is inflamed in throat too. The pain and pressure I'm adjacent areas can be radiating pain from wisdom tooth site. White in the extraction socket is the healing tissue that graphically changes color from red of blood clot to white and so on as it is helpful in healing of the extraction site. So if there is pain take painkillers like Ibuprofen, Naproxen etc. Do cool compresses over the weekend. Follow all other post-operative instructions given to you. If there is no improvement in next one week consult an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated. Hope this helps. Regards."}

Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor Your description of the rash and associated pain does seem to suggest a possibility of Shingles; more so if the rash is arranged in a stripe like pattern across one half of the body, with a sharp mid-line cut off. Shingles may initially start either as rash or as raised patches and subsequently may develop fluid filled lesions. Therefore, absence of fluid filled lesions from the start doesn't rule out shingles. Pain is more of a feature of herpes Zoster; irritation to the muscle rub would have been associated with a burning sensation rather than pain. I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. A dermatologist would be better able to confirm it or rule it out. There is usually associated pain which may be shooting or stabbing in quality. If Shingles is confirmed to be shingles on visual inspection, treatment would be with an oral antiviral e.g. acyclovir or val acyclovir. Associated pain also need to be managed appropriately with NSAIDsFirst step would be to visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosisRegards"}

Which causes breathlessness. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 2D Echo to rule out this. It is better to get done surgical repair of valvular repair. So discuss all these with your doctor and start treatment."}

I am 62 and weigh 230 and for the past 6 months I have had very intense chest pain. I have gone to the ER numerous times and have followed up with my Cardiologist. The following exams have been done: bloodwork, EKG, catscan of the heart, stress test, sonogram of the chest, chest x-ray, and a I wore a 24 hr heart monitor. All test continue to come back negative and I am sent home each time with a clean bill of health.

I keep thinking that maybe there is another underlying cause that is being overlooked. I am still concerned that I may have a cardiac related problem.

First, no need to worry about heart diseases as a cause for your chest pain because your extensive cardiac work up is normal.

Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of intense chest pain. Only Chat Doctor.  1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 2. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Go for walking after meals. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. Follow all these and you will mostly improve. Sometimes, musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar kind of pain. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

It would have been perfect if you had mentioned the details of the MRI reports as we could have understood something from it. If you have any issue with the intervertebral disc and nerve entrapment. Now since you are mentioning pain in the hip, thigh, leg and back, I would like to know if the pain symptom is radiating in nature?  Also, how is the back pain? Is the nature of the pain sharp shooting or dull aching. If dull aching then it will be related to muscle but if sharpshooting than it will be for nerve. Now coming to an analysis of you, you mentioned your age is 38, so we can look for some Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.  Due to which there might be changes of back pain and nerve getting trapped. For this I will recommend you to try out the exercise for the core, back and lower limbs on both sides.  It is mandatory to do exercise in any back pains or radiating pains as due to pain there is a muscle weakness which gets build up over a period of time and once the muscles are weak there is instability of the spinal column. I wish you check for your blood glucose levels along with uric acid too, so we can have a differential diagnosis made to rule out the possibility because.  If you can still mention in detail about the MRI it will be really kind of you. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, many back cases associated with leg pain are doing well with conservative management. Like - exercise, physical therapy and yoga.

Closed is ovulation inducing Chat Doctor.  But many people with PCs sometimes won't respond to closed. This is common. So next step would be combining closed with FSH injection. Phaeton helps endometrium to prepare for pregnancy.  If pregnancy doesn't happen then period comes. If pregnancy occur then duphastone prevent early abortion. Though you ovulate if sperm cant meet the egg fertilization won't occur.  I would advise you to get your husband semen analysis.  If it is normal along with closed and FSH go for GUI. Yes GUI increase chances of pregnancy as here sperms are washed and placed in uterus. I suggest you to reduce weight as that help in ovulation a lot . Hope I have been helpful. Regards"}

The initial management of cervical disc disease is always by conservative management (non-surgical methods) and includes the following -Soft Collar: Soft collar allow the muscles of the neck to rest and limit neck motion. This can help decrease pinching of nerve roots with movement. Soft collars should only be worn for short periods of time, because long-term wear can decrease the strength of neck muscles. Medicines: Analgesic are needed in the acute phase. Muscle relaxants are essential for relieving muscle spasms once the acute pain subsides. Neurotrophic vitamins like METHYLCOBALAMINE (activated It B12) or PREGABALIN will help in alleviating the neuropathic pain. Cervical traction: may enlarge the disc space, permitting the prolapse to subside. Intermittent cervical traction for not more than 30 minutes at a time. Physiotherapy: Once the acute phase of pain has subsided, Isometric strengthening exercises of the paravertebral muscles are started. Improving neck strength and flexibility with simple exercises may lessen discomfort and pain. Moist heat can be usefulEpidural steroids: are useful for patients with severe articular pains in the limbs. Cortisone is a powerful anti-inflammatory preparation and so its injections in the \"epidural space\" can decrease swelling as well as pain. If your symptoms are not resolving with the above measures, consult an orthopedic surgeon for further management. Hope this information is helpful. Good day"}

He put me on antibiotics and said to  take one pill each day for five days and I already took 4. Im starting to notice ringing in my ears now, more like a buzzing sound. Could this be something to do with my bronchitis?", "output": "Thank you for your queryBronchitis is an inflammation of the small airways in your lung. This could be associated with allergies/asthma, infection of the respiratory tract. Secretions develop in response to inflammation and infection. This helps with clearing the airways. Sometimes when there is too much, it enters our larger airways and requires us to cough it out. This process and an inflammation /infection in our throat could cause swelling of the throat and associated structures (ears, nose). The middle ear is connected to the throat by the Eustachian tube, one on either side (This helps to regulate pressure in the ear). The nose is connected to several sinuses (air filled pockets in our face that help to regulate voice). When there is repeated or prolonged increase in pressure in these areas (blowing your nose too hard, coughing, swelling in these areas), it can affect the pressure within the ear and result in tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Ear infections or inner ear pathology may also be associated with tinnitus. Once the bronchitis and associated symptoms are better, the ringing should subside and go away. If this does not happen or if this interferes with your hearing, see an ENT (ear/nose/throat)specialist who can quickly examine you and treat any underlying causes. .hope this helps.

He told me he was going to wait until October to go back and do another surgery to make sure that my back is healed. For the next 4 to 5 months I was taking strong pain medication to reduce my pain. In June I stopped taking them and i was doing good for 3 months. But now that im back to school and playing volleyball the pain came back but it was worse. I have about 2 episodes of stabbing and burning pain just above the screw every hour. I was wondering if it was maybe a broken screw?", "output": "HiT hank you for your question to Chat Doctor. Causes of back pain after spinal surgery are several and may be hardware related or pathology in the back itself.Some common causes are infection, nonunion of the bones one of the strong predisposing factors for which is infection and prominent hardware. Screw heads may become prominent in thin individuals and cause problems. Infection is a major concern if there is increasing pain and MRI scan and blood tests can help with diagnosis. Diagnosis of nonunion requires a CT scan. An X-ray will reveal a broken screw in most of the cases. CT scan images the spine in three dimensions and is confirmatory. For your condition I would recommend a CT scan and MRI of the spine with and without contrast. A prominent or broken screw is uncommon to be the cause of pain by itself. It is the nonunion which is indirectly indicated by a broken screw that is the cause of pain. Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Wish you the best."}

For stomach to have a proper function the abdominal muscles need to be strong to support the stomach. Now stomach muscles are soft tissue muscle and abdominal are skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscles are controlled by human desire and soft tissue are by the autonomous nervous system. The exercise which you need to do it - straight crunches for the upper abdomen. Later crunches for the side muscles of the abdomen. The procedure is simple. Lye down on the mat with crook lying position. Then lift the head and shoulder 2-4 inches off the floor and try going towards the knee. And the other one you should do later bend. This is one of the simplest forms to give support to the stomach muscles providing good strength. You can the videos online as well. Hope I have answered your query.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. You should not worry, I will explain you something and give you my opinion. This seems to be a heart rhythm issues. There are some electrical impulses that generate in a part of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm. This cause a premature heart contraction, that's not a normal one. You feel this like a palpitation, like a skipped beat that makes you cough or have difficulties in breathing deeply. There might be different causes of this rhythm issues like stress, coffee consumption, alcohol, so you have to avoid this. Pathology like anemia, hyperthyroidism, electrolytic disturbances or cardiac anomalies might be other causes. So, electrolyte disturbances, thyroid or parathyroid gland problems might explain even your hands problems, numb or tingly sensation, so you have to check them. If I was your treating doctor I will ask for some examination like a full blood check up, your thyroid problems, a cardiac echo, and a holder rhythm monitoring. Through this we can better know what we are dealing with and how to treat them. As you say, you have a very stress period and this might be the cause. It will soon pass. Hope I was helpful.

She recently told me it is an abscessed tooth. And that there is a small red spot on her gum around it. She said it could possibly be a hole but it looks like just a small red spot. She doest have the money to see a dentist or have it pulled or treated. She has been waiting on her medicaid for almost a year and they keep messing it up. Im scared she might die :/ please.. what can we do? I have no job and she has no job and no one will help us. We need to get her tooth fixed before its too late :/", "output": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The pain in the tooth could be because of the tooth infection. The red spot is because of the pus discharging sinus tract secondary to abscess in the root tip of the infected tooth. You can take a course of antibiotics and analgesics like amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 400 mg TID for 5 days. Do saline gargling. You have to consult an endodontist to get the infected tooth treated. There is no other option. After taking antibiotics you can get the tooth treated with RCT(if bone support is fine) or extraction for tooth infection. Do not worry your girlfriend will not die because of this reason. Try to get it treated as early as possible, wherever you can get it done free. I hope my answer will help you, take care."}

It usually occurs around the middle age and presents with radiological features similar to your case and CURABLE by surgery alone. However, it can only be confirmed by a biopsy(needle or open) or cytology. In my opinion as a Pathologist, A Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)OR an Incisional Biopsy both can confirm the true nature of your husbands lump. It is mandatory and essential for categorization and treatment. Though you did not mention the duration of the lump your husband is suffering from, and I suspect it is a long time(months). If that is the case, it emphases the presence of a benign lesion like lipoma. In conclusion, I would like to mention that, FNAC is a much faster and day care procedure which can alleviate your mental tension quickly. The only downside is you have to go for a biopsy ultimately if it fails or not done and reported by a person who is experienced and familiar with the procedure. Hope this helps.

The foot and leg became so large, it was having eruptions of liquid like volcanos. And all this occurred within a 2 hour period. This happened to me several years ago and was diagnosed as cellulitus. I was put on 4 IVs of antibiotics overnight. The typical blood poisoning red traces were visible slowly moving up my leg. They mentioned that it could have been a spider bite or something infecting the little toe where it started. I have been researching cellulitus and brown recluse spider bites and none of the symptoms described are what I had. So now I am confused as to what may have happened to cause such a bizarre affliction. Any ideas?", "output": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Many of the spider bites usually do not cause much harm except for some spiders like black widow spider and brown recluse spider. Your symptoms are suggestive of a brown recluse spider bite where the skin around the bite wound swells and reddens due to a local reaction. Such wounds should be cleaned thoroughly to avoid secondary bacterial infection. Based on the symptoms you have mentioned in your query, I suspect the above scenario where your wound was not attended to in time and secondary bacterial infection has occurred leading to cellulitis. Cellulitis is caused by bacteria like staphylococcus and streptococcus. You were correctly treated by broad spectrum antibiotics as cellulitis spreads very fast and cause septicemia.

First time listening something like this. Also, maybe the attending physician has meant, that there is a weakness of the muscles of one shoulder when compared to another, apart from that I do not understand what is an underdeveloped shoulder. Not when you mention the pain in the neck and shoulder, I think this should be related to the cervical radiculopathy. If you can take an MRI of the cervical spine we can understand some things better. Because the pain in the neck and shoulder can be due to two reasons, one it might be inflammation of the trapezius muscle or might be the nerve entrapment. I will advise you to take a neck collar and use it for a week or two, during this use hot water fermentation for the neck, upper back and shoulder - front and back region. See if you find any changes if any muscle inflammation is present than you might get relief of it, and later you can do some slow strengthening exercises under a guided physiotherapist for both the neck and the shoulder muscles.

The finding of a few simple cysts on an ultrasound in and of itself would not warrant further evaluation. The findings of a cyst that would warrant further evaluation would be large size (right around where his are or greater), complexity of the cyst by imaging which would indicate that it is not just fluid-filled or any masslike characteristics. If the original imaging was done in May 2011 and there has been no change in the size, it would seem unlikely to be of any significance. To reassure yourself, I would suggest that you request an MRI to further characterize the cyst as well as urine cytology. Benign findings on an MRI and negative urine cytology would be highly reassuring without the need for further extensive workup."}

Since, you had taken plenty of radiation and chemotherapy, better to start palliative treatment in the form of nutrition and pain management. Better to discuss end of life issues with your family. Start centrally acting painkiller for pain relief. There is nothing much to be done in your case, so accept the situation."}

She is still in server pain, still extremely unwell.. Can you shed any light", "output": "Urinary tract infection could be a possible cause of low back pain. Please complete the full course of antibiotics and see if she gets relief. Another possible cause of such pain could be improper posture during sitting or lying down which may trigger spasm of the lower back muscles. She needs to learn certain back exercises from a physical therapist and that should help. Hot compress is likely to give her some relief."}

Rarely thoracic disc herniation (midback) can lead to such symptoms and MRI of the thoracic spine would be the next step if no correlating picture is found in lumbar spine. Hope this is helpful.

In every case of this is available, it should be always accepted to have home dialysis since this is more practical and may spare you lot of time and be less psychologically traumatic. The obvious advantage of peritoneal dialysis is that regular visits to a dialysis unit aren't required, and it can be carried out at home without needing any bulky hemodialysis equipment. One of the main disadvantages of peritoneal dialysis is that it needs to be carried out every day, which you may find very disruptive and another major disadvantage of peritoneal dialysis is that you're at risk of developing peritonitis however this is rarely seen and usually signs of this infection will be obvious, so you will consult doctor on time if it happens. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.

The redness is not gone and will turn dark red before going back to a lighter shade when i move my toe around like when I am walking, but I have no other symptoms whatsoever, and I feel totally normal head to toe. I would be appreciated if a few of you could take the time to give me your medical opinion. Do I really have a bone infection?", "output": "Hi, I'm sorry to hear you've been diagnosed with a bone infection. I can understand your question as the treatment for a bone infection takes a long time, often for at least six weeks. If the MRI showed signs of infection and other markers like C-reactive protein were high, you could presume there was a bone infection.  If they did a blood culture that grew a bacterium, or did a bone biopsy that showed infection, that would support the diagnosis, but is not absolutely necessary. Even though all your blood work looks good now, and you don't have any symptoms, I would encourage you to finish the treatment your doctor has started until complete, since it takes a long time to clear an infection in the bone, and it may seem like you're healed but if you stop antibiotics early the infection may come back.

I am also wondering, I have to get the MMR for my job and I am also taking Metformin to stimulate ovulation. Do I have to stop taking this medication or do I just need to use a form of birth control for 4 weeks?", "output": "Hi, It is not safe to take MMR vaccine while becoming pregnant. As per the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, should be given a month or more before pregnancy because of the safety concerns. It can also be safe for you to take MMR right after giving birth, even while you are breastfeeding. If you need to get vaccinated for MMR avoid becoming pregnant until one month after receiving the MMR vaccine. So, in view of the above you may need to take birth control pills for at least one month after taking MMR. Metformin is safe during pregnancy hence it can be taken as prescribed by your doctor.

It is addictive and very difficult to treat. I told this patient what I will tell you. It is important to remove triggers from your environment, things that make you want to masturbate, that remind you of masturbating. Television, videos, internet, magazines... these can all be sources for temptation that make it hard for you to resist. I would start by changing your environment. It also helps to keep a journal, writing down your thoughts, feelings, and reasons for wanting to masturbate, to better understand your motivations and gain insight into your addiction. Having a therapist if one is available, one who can maintain confidentiality, is a plus. I would disagree to rush into a marriage just to get out of your masturbation issues. If intimacy with a partner is your issue, it might be helpful to consider trying to desensitize yourself by ad Chat Doctor.  Do you watch pornography? Do you have any history of sexual abuse? You really need to evaluate why you have this problem and try to understand it. It is also, in many ways, a normal thing to try to experiment, masturbate, especially in your teenage years.

However, if it becomes to a point where you cannot maintain relationships, difficulty obtaining a job, or affecting your life in other ways, then it is no longer considered normal but rather an addiction.

The swelling under your neck is maybe either a swollen lymph node or a swollen salivary gland. The lymph nodes below the jaws will get enlarged as a reaction to any local infection like an infected tooth or gums. And the fact that is very painful, it is more indicative of an infection.

This is a common problem experienced by women taking birth control pills. Wat you are taking is a combined pill(levonorgesterl and ethinylestradiol) which contain both estrogen and progesterone. It will take 90 days(3 months) to restore your normal ovulation and periods, once you stop the pills. So hopefully you will have ovulation by mid-March and bleeding by last weeks of march. And be warned that this can vary from person to person. So don't do unprotected Sexual intercourse, as you can still become pregnant these days, if sperm reach your uterus. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health."}

The pain in the legs is caused by muscular contractions, especially after physical exercise. It is typical after a day work in the afternoon or evening. The feeling of the nerve pumping in the head too. It may be caused by the muscular contractions in your scalp, but t may also be explained by vascular disorders inside your head. You should just relax, and do not think about it. It is nothing serious! If you are getting these troubles more often, you should see a doctor, and have a good physical examination.

Slowly it also reduced in frequency and I took another sinogram yesterday and the length was 2.5 cm and without any pus formation observed. My doctor is still insisting on a surgical procedure. Is it advisable or I let it heal on its own.", "output": "Hi! My short answer is YES! Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor, and thanks for your queries! In fact, as per your description, your problem of a perianal abscess is complicated by the formation of a sinus tract; this means a blind tunnel through your normal tissue spaces where there are recurrent infections as the other end is open to the environment; the intensity depends upon local hygiene and your immunity power both of which are highly variable... Therefore, it all needs to be obliterated so that no space of infection is left meaning surgical excision is the final cure for this! Hope this answers your question.

The mark under the elbow that you mentioned might have evolved to become thicker and hence palpable.However, it is important to know what kind of birthmark (hyperpigmented/pigmented/hairy etc.) that you are talking about, which could help us rule out any other cause. By and large it seems to be a benign occurrence and the only thing that needs to be done is keeping a watch for similar lumps on other parts of body or an increase in size of the existing lump. If so, a medical consultation would be advisable. Also rule out some trivial local injury that may have caused a temporary swelling under the elbow.

The hole you are referring to in the throat is called tracheostomy, which is made to give ventilator an opening into trachea-the wind pipe.

She bit the inside of her cheek and lip several times and now its very sore, white/yellow in color and one has cracked open, she can hardly open her mouth.  Should I take her to the doctor?", "output": "Hello, Numb areas can include the cheek, lip and tongue with dental anesthesia. A risk can include biting these areas before the anesthetic wears off. This trauma will cause swelling. In general, you do not have to worry. Initial placement of ice is helpful to limit swelling. Tylenol, at the appropriate dose, can reduce inflammation. Warm salt water rinses and endocrine gels can help provide some relief. Help your daughter avoid the area and maintain a soft diet. Normal sensation should have returned to her mouth. Inform your dentist of this condition. Consider completing less dental treatment in a visit, so there is less numbness afterwards. A follow-up visit will be needed if condition seems to be getting worse rather than slowly improving. Time to heal will usually be all that is needed. Thank you for your inquiry.

I can understand your problem. Blood in the stool (bleeding per rectum) occurs in patients with cirrhosis of liver due to abnormally dilated veins beneath the lining of food pipe and also in the lower part of rectum.

I am 153cm and weight 81.5kg and I dont have any medical history.", "output": "Hi, How are you doing ? POD (Polycystic ovaries), This is a congenital condition, I mean it is a genetically programmed condition, you get it from your parents. When you suddenly put on weight, this cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone (if I may simulate- haven't you have seen obese men developing breast & in young obese girls, who develop periods at younger age - they all have high levels of Estrogen hormone / female hormone) In your body too when fat, which is a store for tomorrow, is more than normal, this is converted to hormone which tips the balance between FSH (from brain) & the ovarian hormone. FSH(Follicle Stimulating Hormone) as name suggests stimulates follicle from ovary, but once the follicle is big enough to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the same estrogen hormone from ovary. But when the same estrogen hormone is coming from fat, brain is confused & follicle growth stops early at a smaller follicle size & will not rupture, next scan you will see all these follicles as POLY CYSTIC OVARIES.!!! This is usually associated with Obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for few months & later heavy periods with clots & fleshy masses, or spotting on & off, Thyroid abnormality & prolactin problem indirectly. You develop that extra-pad of fat around the midsegment of body, especially waist, thighs & breast, no fat beyond elbow & knees. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall, dark shade over lower half of face, acne, oily face skin, black skin over back of neck, inner thighs & under surface of breast. May have a family history of Diabetes, especially father or his family. This will not allow ovulation to occur at time & so you cannot get pregnant, till treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution. Your weight has to be Weight(in Kg)= Height (in CMS)-100Your expected weight is 53-58 kg. Once you reduce weight to normal range, you won't need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant & pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight -NO FASTING, No junk food/ fast foods/ red meat, reduce snacks in between mealsHave low calories' food, high proteinsRegular exercise (especially for the waist & hip area), aerobics, yoga, brisk walking(swing your hands well) ,try to reduce 2-4 kg / month. Don't hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 5 kg, you will see changes. When you take Primolut-N only your periods get altered, does not do any good or bad to your pregnancy chances Hope I have clarified your queries. Do write back if anymore queries the best"}

From your history, it is possible that you had a chance conception with a miscarriage which is partial. That is why there was dark bleeding followed by a pink discharge. Urine and blood pregnancy tests might not have become positive by this time. The only way to know is to go and consult a gynecologist who may also go for a pelvic ultrasound of yours for a diagnosis. The headaches and frequent urination might be due a co-existing Urinary Tract and pelvic Infection following the miscarriage. I suggest you not to delay visiting your gynecologist.

OCD is a highly distressing condition but is amenable to treatment. You should talk to your parents regarding seeking a psychiatric consultation for yourself. Treatment with medications like fluoxetine will be helpful. In addition, you can also opt for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) in form of exposure and response prevention. It will consist of sessions which will help in reducing the obsession and the compulsions. I do hope that I was able to answer your query. Best wishes for a speedy recovery."}

Progressive motility is very similar to the motile% As yet I have not managed to get women who I am donating for during their ovulation pregnant.

The motility is slightly low though normal range is more than 32% as per WHO guidelines of 2010 which used to be earlier set at more than 50%. So the motility is slightly less. That could lead to the failure. There is a possibility of infection in the area which is one of the commonest causes of decreased motility. I suggest you get a Semen culture done and if it is positive you take a course of antibiotics. If it is negative then you might require some other form of treatment for the low motility.

It can be high is mild infections and inflammations. Jumping into the diagnosis of cancer straight away is not a good approach. First, rule out local infectious causes. Even normally, sometimes the WBC count is high. Cancer in the scrotum usually presents with a painless swelling or nodule of one testicle. In addition, sometimes it presents as dull ache or heavy sensation in the lower abdomen. Without actually confirming the cancer by histopathological examination, nothing can be said for sure. In my personal opinion, I do not think there is any cancer at all. Hope this helps. "}

At that time, for about three weeks, I was confused and felt demented. Since then, I have largely recovered but feel some mild persisting reduction in intellectual functioning. My wife and I are considering moving from our present large single-family home to a senior-living community. Should we, considering the MRI findings, give preference to facilities equipped to deal with mental decline? If so, how much?", "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. The MRI scan brain is as explained below. Brain shows changes due to aging and this has been written are prominent ventricles and cisterns and also reduce brain volume. This is not a serious condition and is an expected finding in the elderly. Confluent periventricular T2 and FLAIR increased signal intensities is due to partial effects of decreased blood flow through the small arteries in the brain. This is nothing serious and can be seen in many people. This happens earlier in those having diabetes and hypertension. The acute brain allergic reaction is not responsible for all your finding in the brain. There is no requirement to seek additional facilities to deal with mental decline if you have made a near complete recovery from the confused and demented state you have had previously. Since you are 85 years old, a little amount of brain volume loss and ischemic small vessel changes are in line and not a big concern if thinking of moving to a community facility for elderly."}

If your pain is from only inserting your penis, you may want to try using a lubricant, which will make your intimacy more comfortable and pleasurable for the both of you. A lack of lubrication can pull the skin of the penis in uncomfortable ways during sexual activity during inserting and cause pain. Also indulge in good amount of foreplay to allow adequate arousal and emotional connectivity with your partner.

The increase in pain after procedure could be due to small pieces of stones which broke from main big stone while removing or big stone is crushed to make it into small pieces so that it can be easily removed. These small left over pieces of stone try to pass out with urine and cause sever colicky pain. Colicky pain is always very sever, and it is due to obstruction of hollow viscus. She might be getting sever colicky pain when these small pieces of stone pass through with urine. The treatment she is receiving is right. She has to be on higher doses of strong painkiller like morphine or ketamine. Once all leftover pieces of stone pass away with urine she will have relief from pain.

He has been mostly bedridden due to a fall where he substained a compressed fracture. He has had to go to the doctors in an ambulance, is this really necessary to have removed.", "output": "Hi, How are you? I am so sorry to hear about your fathers condition. One thing not clear form your question is whether the stone in the bile duct was removed. Stenting is normally done after ERCP and stone removal to give the bile duct a chance to heal. Once adequate time has elapsed, the stent no longer serves any purpose and hence is removed. The reason it has to be removed or exchanged with a new one at regular intervals is due to the fact that long-standing stents are prone to blockage and infection both of which can have potentially serious consequences. But given your dads condition, and if he does not have any symptoms like pain, fever, jaundice, etc. it is my opinion that you could wait on the stent removal with a very, very low threshold to get it removed if any symptoms arise.

Im concerned with the two anti-depressants at once and have not read the usage of amitriptyline for nerve pain anywhere that Ive done searches.Thanks pb", "output": "Hi I am Chat Doctor. .  Actually amitriptyline HCl is a type of antidepressant used for balancing chemicals in your brain. Sometimes used as a painkiller or a sedating agent to help you sleep with patients having severe chronic pain.  You could not use it without your doctor prescription especially with Prozac as both antidepressants may cause severe side effects sometimes very dangerous or even fatal with increased doses.  In my opinion if you have a kind of neuropathic pain pregabalin or gabapentin will be more reliable but you have to ask your trading doctor for best dosing if you are using any other medications for other health issues.  You may avoid heavy lifting, over weighing, vigorous movements, bad sleeping or sitting postures and high cholesterol or high protein and salty components, and you will feel better soon.  For my patients I recommend painkillers like Advil tab when needed, hot gentle massaging with topical gels of anti-inflammatory, B12 vitamin supplements, muscle relaxants will be effective for most of the cases. Steroid tabs or injection may be needed in more sever cases.  B12 supplements and pregabalin have best results with nerve pains, if pain persist I recommend some lab investigations like urinalysis, ASCOT, Rheumatoid factor and X-rays, MRI and follow them up with your physician for proper evaluation and management of the underlying causes of such nerve pain.

Since you have got disc prolapse at two levels and not relieves with medication and physiotherapy it might be helpful. But what are the canal diameter at disc levels that is not mentioned.

The pinkish bump on scrotal sac is most likely to be A Sebaceous Cyst.However, diagnosis can be confirmed only on clinical examination in person by a qualified General Surgeon or urologist. The scrotal skin is rich in sebaceous glands and hence prone to get more sebaceous cyst due to accumulation of sebum beneath the skin. Normally they fade away without treatment however need to be treated if increase in size or get infected.

The pain radiates into my ribs and down into my hip. I have scoliosis which was detected recently. Did not have it as a child or at all until now. My rib is protruding and obvious to the sight. I had a rotator cuff surgery two years ago which included a major surgery with five anchors. My tail bone hurts now from a fall I took a month ago. The x-ray showed in my spine at that time of the fall that I had two compression fractures that were old. I did not know I had them. I can t sleep and the pain is horrible .", "output": "Your lower back pain could be related to the compression fractures or from local inflammation that developed late. There are a few options for managing this pain1. I would recommend a repeat X-ray of the spine to exclude any changes in the bones since the original fall (since the last X-ray was one month back its possible things have changed since then)2. Physical therapy is often very helpful and can be tried3. In terms of medications, you could try Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not take more than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen over a 24-hour period. You can also try Ibuprofen (400-800 mg three times a day with food)- it has an anti-inflammatory effect. Do not take Ibuprofen if you have a history of chronic kidney disease, bleeding from your gut or severe reflux. Since the X-ray will need to be ordered and interpreted by a physician, I recommend you see your primary care doctor too."}

You know that YOU as a person started existing in this world as a single celled organism in your mothers womb when the half cell of your father in the form of sperm and half cell of your mother in the form of ovum got united. Your present structure of your body was there in the single cell in a miniature form. You know that your present mind also originated from that single cell. If your body and mind took their origin from that primordial single cell, your health also should have its origin from your parents. Then what about your ill health? It also should have its origin definitely from your parents. We call this genetic science in Homeopathy the theory of Miasma. This simply means your health and disease are decided by your genetics. Your environments influence you positively or negatively to precipitate your inborn genetic tendencies in the form of various diseases. Now coming back to your panic attacks. You have agreed that you are hypersensitive physically to smell, food items etc. Similarly, your mind also is hypersensitive to the extent of producing panic attacks. Till date, you have not got any curative treatment because conventional medicine does not have at present a genetic and constitutional treatment method to help you and that is why your doctors explained it away as electrical. The reasons you mention are only triggering factors and till this day you are not cured. I am a Homeopath, and therefore I can confidently say that Homeopathy can cure you because Homeopathy is the only method today that considers your genetics and constitution to find your curative individualistic remedy.

Even though your one tube is removed, remaining one tube is very much capable of picking up the eggs discharged from both the ovaries for conception, provided that tube is patent. I would advise you to undergo hysterosalpingography (X-ray of the uterus and tube after filling in radio-opaque dye) and/or Laparoscopy to assess then patency of the tube, normalcy of the uterine cavity (HSG) and any adhesions in the pelvis (Laparoscopy). 2. You are having irregular menstruation. Though one test by ovulation monitoring kit has indicated ovulation, maybe you are not ovulating regularly every month. You may undergo regular ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography. This will guide you for the day of intercourse also. Furthermore it can find out the thickening of the uterine lining and size of the follicle when egg was released. Follicles between 18-21 mm size give best results. 3.

Lifestyle modifications include weight reduction, moderate exercises and having diet containing moderate amounts of good fat. Avoid alcohol and smoking.4.

I have asthma. but i feel not normal, because when i breath, my chest in pain. a lot of pain..my back also in pain when my heart beat very fast. i feel the pain on my left side.", "output": "Hello. Welcome to Chat Doctor. Chest pain, breathlessness and fast heart rate while walking or during any exertion can be due to angina. When you walk or exert, the hearts' oxygen demand increases and hence the blood flow to the heart also increases. If the arteries are having blockages, then this supply is hampered leading to chest pain, breathlessness. The heart tries to compensate by beating faster hence the fast heart rate. Breathlessness in your case can also be continued by asthma. I recommend you do an ECG and a 2 d echo for cardiac evaluation. If both ECG and 2d echo are normal then you must undergo a stress test. It tests the functional capacity of the heart and can predict presence of blockages in the heart. Also, I hope you are compliant on your asthma medications and inhalers. I suggest you do a PFT (pulmonary function test) also to evaluate the functional capacity of the lungs. All these together will give a definite reason for your symptoms. Wishing you good health Regards."}

Cancer symptoms of bowel includes sudden change in bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea. Some people also experience bleeding in stools. Unexplained loss of weight can also be seen in bowel cancer. Since you have recent onset diarrhea then you should get a detailed cancer screening examination done. I suggest you get your stools tested for occult blood till the time you have to wait to see your surgeon. If there is occult blood in stools and as you have strong family history therefore you should get a colonoscopy done. It will locate any abnormal areas of polyps which are precursors to colon cancer. Doing colonoscopy and ultrasound scan of abdomen might highlight any suspicious area causing you the strange feeling whether inside the bowel or anything on the outside. Please do not worry."}

Any time you have a red lesion on the side of the tongue that persists longer than a few weeks it is important to have it evaluated in person by a dentist and possibly biopsied.  Oral cancer can occur at any age and is very common on the side of the tongue.  The tried and true method of identification is through biopsy.  Many lesions can appear flat, red and on the side of the tongue.  Highly unlikely that it is cancer at your age, but safe to rule out if it doesn't go away.  Geographical tongue does have a border but not always apparent.  It can also be lichen plans, trauma from an adjacent tooth, chemical burn from medication, new toothpaste, mouth rinse or spicy/citric foods.  I hope this helps you. Best wishes, good health. "}

With regards B.N.Datta, India, e-mail : YYYY@YYYY", "output": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is primary malignancy arising from the lymph nodes. The lymphoma can spread to surrounding soft tissue. Thus, the lymphoma detected in the soft tissue of the mandible is actually the lymphoma arising in the lymph node involving the adjacent soft tissue. The treatment of the lymphoma involving the lymph node as well as the adjacent soft tissue is similar to lymphoma involving the lymph node alone. Involement of other lymphoid tissues at distant sites should also be sought as this involvement determines the stage of the disease. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "}

I am worried it may be a swollen lympth node. Any advice?", "output": "Hi, thank-you for providing the brief description of your injury A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. As mentioned by you the mechanism of injury I will advise to first get it clinically assessed. As we need to see any muscular or bony injury is present. Also, as you mentioned you were not able to close the jaw, there may be an inflammation of the joint as well as the muscles of the post. May be to come closer to the diagnosis the CT or MRI may be advised to see the bone and the soft tissue status. As head and neck are really an important part of the body, negligence is not advised. Usually due to injury there may be three possibilities - no injury at all, injury to the bone or injury to the muscle & nerves. For coming closer to the issue, a proper assessment is advised. Also, in the front of the neck there is a presence of cartilages which needs an attention. Post that clinical assessment & if needed an MRI or CT the next treatment plan will be initiated based on the symptoms and signs. I wish you a good health and advise avoiding such fights in the future. Life is very important and precious.regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "}

Thanks for your query. From your words it appears that you are allergic to certain metals, so it's best to avoid them.

If it gets infected and forms pus then you may need antibiotic ointment too. Do consult a Dermatologist and do the allergen-specific IGE antibody testing to screen for an allergy to a specific substance or substances and avoid contact to such substances in the future.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor.First, I would suggest you to complete the course of corticosteroid Chat Doctor.  I would also add montelukast & levocetirizine orally.First, in case of allergic keratoconjunctivitis, there is abnormality in structure of eye. So please don't worry about build up of her eye. Allergy is an abnormal reactivity of immune system. If she has recurrent allergic conjunctivitis, it is important to identify allergen causing her symptoms. For that I would suggest consulting an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise her some allergy testing and identify the cause. Allergic keratoconjunctivitis is usually due to an allergic reaction to air-borne allergens like pollen, molds, etc. So they usually come from environment rather than from peers directly.

Usually when hematoma resolves, it changes its color from green to black and disappears. Sometimes if there is some hematoma in deeper layers of tissues, then it might take time to resolve. Since X-ray didn't show any fracture, pain has decreased, and you are able to do routine day-to-day activities, there is nothing to worry. But one month is quite long time for a hematoma to resolve. So, it's better to do an ultrasound and confirm whether the blood collection is still there. If it is, there then surgically removing the collection or just aspirating it by wide-bore needle will help in relieving your symptoms. Get well soon, Regards."}

If you don't have any redness or fever associated i am sure its just inflammatory response, and it will heal.

The body needs iron to make hemoglobin, a protein on RBC's that carries the oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Hemoglobin also gives blood its red color. In addition to lack of iron, there tends to be a lack of vitamin B12 and folic acid in the diet as well. Vitamin B12, vitamin C, and folic acid are all crucial to RBC production, and a deficiency in any one of these vitamins puts you at risk for anemia. Good sources of vitamin B12 include beef and fish. Vegetables don't contain this vitamin, so if you don't eat meat, fish, or dairy products, you'll need to take vitamin B12 supplements.

Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. You have a very good observation indeed. Generally, menstrual cycles are painful as they are ovulatory cycles. Ovulation is the rupture of ovum and release of egg, necessary for fertilization. The oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and makes the cycles ovulatory.  This is one of the main action of OCP in preventing conception. The pain and bleeding during menstruation are due to increased uterine contraction needed to expel the unfertilized egg products in the form of clots. You have no pain and less bleeding with OCP not only because the cycles are ovulatory but also because the bleeding is with Chat Doctor.  Also, with OCP, your periods will be on a regular cyclical pattern. I hope this is useful to you."}

Ideally we should rule out cardiac cause first for your chest pain.  But you don't have an option for ER visit, ECG can not be possible. I think it is HERD (Castro Esophageal Reflux Disease).

Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Start proton pump inhibitor. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed. 7. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have this habit. 8. Lose weight if you are obese."}

It would appear that it would be difficult to maintain both relationships and have both be satisfying, given that you are so obsessed with the other woman. I would need more guidance in terms of what your goal is in order to best help you. Good luck to you."}

Just after the procedure his BP dropped and the doctors fought for almost 5 hours to make him survive the night of the evening. He was a diabetic with kidney issues (CKD 3 stage). The BP got controlled to some extent in the following morning but he started developing other symptoms everyday that started with high WBC count, lungs saturation came to a very low and then creatinine went to 5. He was on ventilattor and had to go through 48 hrs CRT dialysis. What do think go wrong with the procedure to start with? Btw, he came out of life support after almost 5 days and now recovering.", "output": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. As a Urologist, i must opine that, you're richly blessed by GOD almighty. The cardiologists and intensivists team, are to be congratulated for a remarkable resuscitation and successful effort. To begin with, your father had a diabetic nephropathy(Diabetes with CKD stg3), and injecting contrast, is potentially nephrotoxic. But, the only way to do angioplasty is, to do a contrast angiogram study, first. This can lead to acute kidney injury-ARF, where the creatinine goes up, with other side effects, like B.P.fall, and low oxygen saturation. Dialysis is imminent, when creatinine goes up. You may send any doubt, as a direct question to me, for an expert opinion. Chat Doctor.  Manga."}

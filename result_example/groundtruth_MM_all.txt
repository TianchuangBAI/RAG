Hi, How are you? My name is Chat Doctor.  I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I will attempt to answer your question. Cholelithiasis or gall bladder stones is a very common finding in scans of the abdomen. 10% to 20% of population will develop stones at some time in their lifetime. Up to 80% of these patients will never experience biliary pain or complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis.  Hence, most gallstones are clinically "silent," and is an incidental finding often uncovered during abdominal ultrasound being performed for another reason. People with such asymptomatic cholelithiasis, however, eventually may develop symptoms (biliary pain) that require treatment, but this risk is quite low. An even lower proportion (1-2%) may develop major gallstone complications. Therefore, expectant management is an appropriate choice for silent gallstones in the general population. The exception is patients at high risk for experiencing biliary complications - Large gallstones (>3 cm) or gallbladders crammed with stones that carry a higher risk of developing gallbladder cancer. So in your case if you are currently not suffering from any symptoms and all you have is a small stone in the GB, I would advise a "wait and watch" policy. If in future you do develop symptoms like pain, fever, omitting, dyspepsia, etc. then I would get operated on. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a fairly simple and routine surgery done in most surgical centers. Unfortunately once the stones have been formed, there are no medications which will help in treating them. Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better soon. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further clarifications. Have a great day

HI, I understand your concern. Smoking in pregnancy is hazardous to both mother & child.  Smoking in first 3 months increases chances of fetal abnormalities, specially heart problem.  Smoking in early months of pregnancy carries risk of placental complications, abortion, premature deliver, low birth weight, future obesity, future smoking addiction.  Mother also is exposed to pregnancy induced hypertension after smoking in pregnancy followed by further complications like toxemia of pregnancy.  * Its good that you have totally quit smoking at present. You need not start it again to satisfy uncontrollable urge to do so. Trey self-control/ counseling/ chewing clove/ beetle nut as an alternative. DO NOT start smoking again.  - AS you had smoked in early months, it's better to assess babies status as far congenital defects with investigations like 3D USG scan & follow doctors advise as far as its management is concerned.  Thanks.
Based on your symptoms, I suspect that you have dislocated your patella, which is also known as your kneecap.

The only precaution you must follow is not to touch, pinch pop or squeeze any of them otherwise it can get infected and can cause complications. You can apply medium potency steroid cream application such as mometasone or fluticasone cream. You can take antihistamine Ben Chat Doctor. Take care.
Hello Chat Doctor. First step is to take the clothes off of the child. Let him with one layer or naked if possible. You could use again eugenic 200 mg every 6-8 hours, 3 doses in 24 hours and between the medicine you could make your child a bath with warm water. Not with cold water as it will make the temp rise. When bathing with warm water take out a cup with warm water and put in a cup with cold water. So cool it down gradually. If fever persists more than 3 days with full 24 hours send him to the hospital it could be bacterial. Check him up and possibly do a Urinalysis.

Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of chronic inflammation of the spine and the sacroiliac joints. Chronic inflammation in these areas causes pain and stiffness in and around the spine. The treatment of ankylosing spondylitis typically involves the use of medications to reduce inflammation and/or suppress immunity to stop progression of the disease, physical therapy, and exercise. Nucoxia contains etoricoxib which is used to relieve pain and inflammation. The prognosis for patients with ankylosing spondylitis is very much dependent upon the location and severity of its manifestations. The prognosis is best for those who maintain close monitoring with the treating doctors and who incorporate physical activities designed to maintain mobility.  If he is smoking its better quit smoking. Oral or injectable corticosteroids (cortisone) are potent anti-inflammatory agents and can effectively control spondylitis and other inflammations in the body, but can't be used for longer time. I advise him to follow the doctors advice, and he can lead near normal life. Regards
Hi there, A lump in your neck during an ear infection is most commonly an enlarged lymph node. A number of things can cause lymph nodes to become enlarged, but in the vast majority of the time, the cause is an infection. Other causes can be malignancy, but this is much rarer. If the lymph node is tender, it makes malignancy much more unlikely. I'd take ibuprofen and use warm compresses on the affected area. If the lymph node gets smaller, I wouldn't worry about it at all. If it continues to be enlarged, hardened and painless, then I would seek out an ultrasound. Again, I'd give it a week after your other symptoms resolve before I'd start to worry. I hope this answers your question. Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.

Hi, Do not here this nonsense tip given by this type of person. If this is the case then every married man should have lost energy and handicapped ! Masturbation does not have any side effect either less of energy or muscle weakness or not having any bed effect in sex life. This is just like other feelings like thirst, hunger, joy etc. At young age this is common habit where male hormone is its maximum level. So there is no harm doing masturbation. I always advice that keep this habit in control as excess in every thing should be avoided. If one person does not do masturbation, excess amount of semen is going into blood stream, metabolized in the body and will be thrown by kidneys. Ok and take care.

Hello, I went through your query. If more than 75% of tooth structure is lost then placing a crown (cap) on the broken tooth is not recommended. Otherwise, there is a possibility of placing a Post and Core on the tooth. That has to be decided by your dentist based on the condition of the tooth. Also, I would not recommend leave the broken tooth without a crown. And between dental implants and bridge, I would recommend a Dental implant, if the condition of the bone is sound, because it does not involve preparation (cutting) of the adjacent teeth. Hope you are benefited by the answer.

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, this does not carry good prognosis in your mothers case. She is having low heart pumping (25%) and chronic kidney disease (dialysis dependent). So her heart and kidneys are almost non-functioning. When these two organs fail in their work, fluid tend to accumulate in the body. This is the reason why she is having fluid in the lungs. This also causes breathlessness. So breathlessness and fluid in the lungs suggest further deterioration in heart and kidney functions. And hence this carries poor prognosis. Chances of getting better are very, very less. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.

Hello Mr. Mukesh, You said you take alcohol daily and your LFT showed mild increase in Bilirubin levels and liver enzyme levels. It indicates that your liver had some injury due to your alcohol intake. The serum bilirubin levels and liver enzymes levels will revert to normal in few days. But taking alcohol in future may again cause elevation of bilirubin and liver enzymes. Daily alcohol intake may cause Cirrhosis of liver with Portal Hypertension due to which you will have permanent liver failure and it's dangerous to life. About the food, yeah you can take spicy food if you don't have any Gastritis problem. But if you develop Cirrhosis and portal hypertension, you need to take low salt and less spicy food. My advice is to stop taking alcohol and be on follow up with your physician.

PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hello. Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor You seem to have an Chat Doctor.  One month of time is too short for any significant improvement. The increase in hair fall too is not much of a worry once you understand the reason for it.

Brief... if high bilirubin level is physiological then phototherapy or blood exchange (transfusion) is the best treatment. Detailed answer. There can be many causes of high bilirubin level, which are treated accordingly. For example.if there is jaundice within first 24 hrs of birth, it is almost always pathological like because of AGO incompatibility; hereditary He diseases or hereditary biliary sclerosis etc. If jaundice is after 24 hrs of birth, it can be because of breast milk or physiological as liver enzymes are not mature enough to metabolize etc. Well first from the history of your child, it seems that she has been suffering from physiological (normal) jaundice, which can be treated with phototherapy and exchange transfusion. But if bilirubin level is above 20 it can effect brain so the sensory hearing loss and which can be permanent and non-treatable, so better to be on safe side, hearing test should be done, once child is stable.

Hello, Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. Firstly, ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile phase in the cycle when an unprotected intercourse can cause pregnancy.

You have to use a proper pill or go for the insertion of an IUD as an emergency contraceptive. This should be done as soon as possible to prevent failure. Hope this helps.

Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, A lump on right labia could be due to lymph node enlargement or inflamed Catholics gland. A history of bacterial vaginosis can be the cause of lymph node enlargement. The presence of ASC US on Pap smear suggests presence of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.

However, before repeating the pap test treatment for bacterial vaginosis needs to be done because atypical changes in squamous cells may be seen in case of infection. The presence of lump on labia is not related to ASC US. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.

Hi, thank-you for the brief history of your mother. I am sorry to hear that at this age she had to undergo so much pain and aches. Without wasting time, as you told she had a fall, and post that only this blackness on her forehead though it is a month-old injury. I think she had a fall and internal bleeding, that is the reason of the black spot and swelling. Usually any swelling should come by a maximum of week or so. Human body is a self medicine for itself, so body removes the excess waste from the excretory system. Also, I am unsure if you have met a physician that day. If not I will recommend you to meet one and get checked. Also, I am not sure, where at this age she is mobile or no because continuous lying down can also lead to pressure sore at this age. As we age the human body loses its capacity to quick healing. Just on a safer note I recommend visiting a physician and get checked once. If all turns out fine then you can help her by just requesting a physical therapy services at the door step.

Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. As your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, I suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. Also. When there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. As you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain. As I feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. Since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. So before it gets more on future you can get an MRI of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. In my clinical experience I see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with Nerve impingement diagnosis. So, from past couple of years I have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the Neurological pain, so now I deal with first an MRI of spine and core stability. Results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less Regards Jay In Chat Doctor.

Hi, It is not clear from your history what your doctor meant when he said he straightened your fallopian tube, if there were any adhesions which were lased. There are several factors which are responsible for failure to conceive, and tubal factor is one of the most important. I would suggest a proper evaluation by an infertility specialist. You need to test for tubal patency and tubal motility. If nothing can be done, IVF is the ideal solution. Without tubal propulsion of the ovum, insemination is not going to help any better. Hope this helps.
Hi, As you said you have scalp psoriasis...it may be relapsing and may for long time. I hope you might be taking regular and proper treatment of psoriasis from your dermatologist.

Blood tests may be done to monitor the treatment. Apply mild steroid lotion combined with salicylic acid on the scalp lesions. Regular and daily shampoo may be done with tar, salicyliacid and ketoconazole containing shampoo. Avoid stress and worries as that might worsen psoriasis. Avoid bad habit of smoking, tobacco and beverages. Avoid heavy combing of hairs of scalp, so that trauma may be avoided, otherwise that might exacerbate the disease. Have patience for the good result. I hope you got my answer. Thanks.

Hello, I will add Chat Doctor.  One of the causes could be a condition called bronchitis which is a type of inflammation of the lining of our large breathing tube or bronchus. This condition is usually viral and may show slightly higher lymphocytes on your blood count. Blood in the sputum or spit may also arise from the inflammation of the lining of the nose. These conditions are not serious and resolves. However, one should also know that blood in the sputum can arise from tuberculosis or cancer type diseases also which from your description does not appear to be the cause. However, my advice is that you should get a test called peripheral blood smear done. You must also obtain your test report on absolute lymphocyte count. Persistently raised lymphocyte count has to be investigated with additional tests such as flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy. At the moment bone marrow biopsy is not necessary, but you must get a peripheral blood smear examination done by a pathologist along with an absolute lymphocyte count done. You may also feel for any lumps in your neck and armpit. If there are any you must get investigated by a physician promptly. I presume that your platelet count is OK because low platelets can cause bleeding. Overall my opinion is that your blood in the sputum may be a temporary phenomenon as you recover from a viral or allergy related illness, but it is important to also get some investigations done. Therefore, please get the following investigations:Peripheral blood smear with absolute lymphocyte countSputum examination with cytologyChest XRayPlease feel free to clarify your test results also Best regards

Hi, How are you? My name is Chat Doctor.  I am a Liver and Pancreas cancer specialist and I hope to answer your question today. I am so sorry to hear about your patients' diagnosis. The best treatment available for HCC is surgical resection. I understand that within a month of first surgery, there is recurrence of the tumor. This could either be due to incomplete surgery the first time, or due to rapid occurrence of a new tumor. The treatment will now depend on how fit the patient is, How much liver is left behind and what the quality of the remnant liver is. If the liver is normal (without cirrhosis), then I would do a repeat surgery to remove the tumor, provided the amount of liver left behind will be sufficient to carry out the functions. If by scanning, it appears that the remnant liver will not be sufficient, then there are various techniques like RFA, RACE, TARE etc. which can be considered. But still Surgery will be the first choice. Hope this helps and hope your patient starts to feel better. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details. rxsuresh@gmail.comHave a great day

There should not be a bend at elbow which may falsely lower the BP. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.  Regards

Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. The initial management of Spondylolisthesis is always conservative by the following measures -- Avoid excessive forward bending activities as it will worsen the disc protrusion as well as further forward slipping of the vertebra. If you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Avoid lifting heavy weights as it imparts more strain on your back-Maintain optimum body weight, if you are obese. A faster progression of listless and higher chances of worsening are very common in obese individuals.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles and prevent further progression of the listless.- Use analgesic and muscle relaxants as needed. If you fail to improve with the above measures or if your symptoms are worsening in due course of time, then you may need a surgical fixation. Hope this information is helpful. Good day

Hello, I can understand your concern. The white patch on the lips that can be wiped off leaving red area beneath can be fungal infection which should be treated with antifungal medication.

Dear user. Welcome to Chat Doctor .the blood test is much more sensitive than the home urine test. So the first thing to do in your case is to have a quantitative Chat Doctor test in you blood. If the test is negative consider this as an abnormal event that happened due to any reason (stress for an example), and wait for the next cycle. If the test is positive, you should visit your doctor as soon as possible to identify the cause of bleeding and to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Although pregnancy is a remote possibility, but it should be excluded. I hope these words were useful to you. Good luck. Chat Doctor.
avascular necrosis is revascularization of femoral head (loss in blood supply), this causes bone part to become necroses (dead) and becomes susceptible to fracture collapse eventually, when partially necroses, it is very painful on weight-bearing or walking. X-ray shows it as denser area than surrounding or adjacent bone. Once the blood supply is impaired, complete necrosis follows in 6 months to 2 years. So salvage operations are done with prosthetic implants or weight shifting surgery. I hope your doctor has confirmed if it is indeed avascular necrosis. Arthritis is different, in hip, it doesn't lead to avascular necrosis but destruction of joint surfaces and reshaping of joint in later stages. We must be clear whether it is arthritis only or avascular necrosis as treatment varies.It's best to leave it to your orthopedic or hip surgeon to decide diagnosis and treatment. Yes, as you are advised physical therapy it maybe just arthritis, which is more readily manageable conservatively, unlike avascular necrosis which requires surgery more frequently best wishes

Hi there, Thanks for writing in. Initial 24-48 hours after any injury, it is best to use an ice pack intermittently. However, now the injury is almost a week old, in which case hot fomentation would be ideal. Apply a small quantity of pain relief gel like voting(diclofenac gel) to the affected region of the back. Do not massage or rub the gel too much. Just apply it lightly. After half an hour or so apply a hot water bag/ hot fomentation to the affected area. Do the above at least 3 times a day. Reduce the oral intake of ibuprofen gradually. Too much of this pain relief medication can cause gastritis. Hopefully you should be completely okay in another week or so. If the pain persists or increases in intensity, please visit your physician at the earliest... Hope this helps.

Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I would like to know your age. Do you have any family history for cardiac disease? Your symptoms may be related to a cardiac arrhythmia. Anxiety can not be excluded as a possible cause. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x-ray and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, etc.). An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring is necessary to rule in/out a possible cardiac arrhythmia. Further, tests like a cardiac ultrasound should be done if the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia is confirmed. If all the above tests result normal, the most probable cause of your symptomatology would be just anxiety. Hope to have been helpful! Best regards,

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor I can understand your concern. Possibility of aspirin induced gastritis and acid reflux is more but better to rule out cardiac chest pain first.

Angioplasty results after bypass surgery varies from patient to patient. But in general several studies revealed that there is 65-80% success rate of angioplasty in post-CABG (Bypass) patients. When these patients were followed over a period of next 30 months then about 70% of them were pain-free and had an improvement in angina. However, around 27% required repeat angioplasty with about 80% success rate while 15-20% were complicated by re-infarction and only 4-6% with cardiac death. In my opinion proceed with angiography to help determine the extent of blockage and to decide about the options available. Make sure the medications' compliance post-procedure as this is crucial. Stay blessed.

Dear Ajay, You have two level disc degeneration, which is probably the cause of your back pain. Do you have any leg pain also or is it only back pain you are suffering from? If it is only back pain, then treatment will be mostly in the form of physiotherapy. You can take a short, continuous course of pain medications, but definitely not for long time as they are harmful. You should avoid treadmill and weight training exercises. They will do more harm to your back. Swimming or stationary cycle is good. Surgery is the final answer to this kind of problems, and usually gives good result, however you are very young to have this kind of surgery, also you need to try a proper course of physiotherapist to see the real benefit out of it. Hope this helps.

So you may need aspiration of pus and antibiotic treatment with surgical Chat Doctor.  For all these, better to consult doctor. Also avoid too much moisture and keep proper hygiene of anal region.

Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. First, I would suggest you not to manipulate treatment without checking with doctor. It can be really harmful to change dose/timings of medications by self.2. Common cause of asthma-like illness at 9 months of age is viral infection. So temperature can go up and down due to infection itself. Correlation of temperature with dosage of medicines may be a co-incidence.3. Some cough syrups/medications for respiratory illnesses may contain Chat Doctor.

Hi Right sided lower abdominal pain can be due to Appendicitis, Right sided kidney stone, Right ovarian cyst etc. But, a 2cms cyst will not cause such pain. As kidney stones are ruled out on scan, it can be Appendicitis. Unless appendix is grossly enlarged, it cannot be seen in ultrasound scan. Sometimes, after surgery there will be adhesions, and it may cause pain intermittently. If there is distension of abdomen, vomiting and constipation, surgery should be done. Get a CT scan abdomen for correct diagnosis. My first possibility is AppendicitisWish you good healthRegards

Hi, Thanks for writing in. Sometimes it can get difficult on deciding the treatment of a patient having cancer with metastasis like your father. Chemotherapy can prolong survival in TCC with metastasis. It is important to know accurate details of the tumor in bladder and metastasis location. If the patient is asymptomatic then it is possible to further extend his survival by giving chemotherapy. Chemotherapy agents that have shown activity in metastatic bladder cancer include paclitaxel, docetaxel, ifosfamide, gallium nitrate, and gemcitabine and these are promising as they extend the survival of the patient even with metastasis. I suggest you discuss in detail with the second oncologist and then take an informed decision. Pain relief is an important part in treating cancers and this assumes a greater significance in those with metastasis. Pain relief is given using a step approach and that much of pain relief is given which can allow the patient to stay in comfort. Pain relievers are usually opioids and controlled medications.

Welcome at Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and being your doctor I completely understand your health concerns.... Are you having jaundice? Any history of fever?  Based upon the history I don't think the medicines which you have used have caused it. In my opinion it is most probably due to the ingestion of alcohol intake.

Hope your query is adequately answered Regards Chat Doctor.

Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The reason for swelling could be because of the persistent infection or its relative feeling of swelling secondary to the numbness. The numbness in the lip and chin could be because of the trauma to the nerve during injection of the local anesthesia, or it can be because of pressure caused by any cyst or tumor on the nerve ending. Clindamycin will clear the infection, but it will not solve the numbness problem. You can take nerve regenerating Chat Doctor.  But you have to rule out the cause of numbness so consult your oral physician and get a radiograph done. I hope my answer will help you. Take care

Hello dear! I can understand your concern as I am a mother too. It feels heartbroken to see your child in misery. I would advise you to make a diet chart based on her caloric requirement according to her current weight and considering the ideal weight at this age. Suppose at this age, she should have a weight of at least 35 kg, which I am sure she wont be. So you should start with LEAST 60% of the required calories of this weight that is 1800 calories (60% would be around 1000 calories)I am making a sample of diet chart which you can give to her and gradually increasing calories. Starting from 8 am give her whole egg in the form of a purÃ©e made with poring egg in about 5 ounces of boiled milk and gradually stirring with a whisk.it will be like a custard. Add in 2 teaspoons of sugar and a Chat Doctor. At 10 am you can give chicken stock made with about a 100 gm of chicken in water with selected spices like black pepper or paprika and salt, whichever she likes.it will provide around 150 calories save the meat of chicken and blend it with a cup of wheat cereal with a little stock if remaining)it will provide around 250 calories. At 12 noon you can give about a cup of rice pudding made with 4-5 ounces of boiled rice and 8-10 ounces of milk with added sugar if she likes and a cardamom to enhance the flavor. It will provide around 200-250 calories.at 2 pm you can give her mashed veggies like a mashed potato medium-sized.you can also grill with butter and sprinkle some salt and then mesh it with chicken stock or milk or anything you like. It will provide around 150 calories and with added butter and stock around 250-300 calories. At 4 pm repeat the wheat and chicken stock (wheat cereal/oatmeal is high in fiber to avoid constipation). At 6 pm give her banana shake.2 bananas in 5-6 ounces of milk, it will provide around 200 calories. At 8 pm give her lentil soup (about 100 grams) with selected spices. It will provide around 250 calories in almost a cup of 5-6 ounces. At 10 pm repeat rice pudding At 12 midnight give her warm milk about 5-6 ounces with a tablespoon of olive oil. It will enhance the calories and relieve constipation. Hope it will help. You can always make variations in the diet with the choice of ingredients. Wishing your child good health :-)

Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your mothers situation and problem. Since, she had history of minor heart attack and stressful life, better to rule out heart disease first for her symptoms. So get done1. ECG2. 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry about cardiac cause. Chest tightness is mostly due to stress and anxiety. So ask her to avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. She may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor. So don't worry, she will be alright.
Based on your symptoms, it seems like you have acute stress reaction.
Hello, Ammonia is the end product of the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds, is neurotoxic at elevated concentrations. Normally liver clears almost all the ammonia by converting it into glut amine and urea preventing entry into the systemic circulation. In advance liver disease or cirrhosis, the level of blood ammonia increases due to impaired liver function and shunting of blood around the liver. In addition, muscle wasting may increase ammonia level since muscle is also an important site for ammonia removal. So, when the liver is damaged, excess of ammonia can build up in the bloodstream and affect the function of the nervous system resulting in hepatic encephalopathy. So, excess of ammonia enters into systemic (blood) circulation causing The excess level of ammonia can be reduced by giving laxative (Lactulose) to prevent bacteria in the intestines from creating ammonia and by certain antibiotics such as Aureomycin or Rifaximin which kill the bacteria which produce ammonia in the gut. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

First you have to confirm it is ring worm because unless we have proper diagnosis there no any use of unnecessary treatment. So my opinion is that take appointment of doctor on priority basis & confirm the thing is ringworm. If it is ringworm then it is transferred to other person only by intimate contact & for getting infected patient must be susceptible. It is not transferred by airborne route & if proper hygienic precautions are taken. If the ring worm is confirmed only topical therapy (local application) will not be sufficient & you should have to take oral antifungal such as Terminating plus local antifungal application such as itraconazole. (for detail therapy consult your dermatologist) My advice is that do not use bleach as it may not be helpful in ringworm infestation instead use one of the above said antifungal cream.
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. I would like to ask you about your symptoms in great detail, like - what are the activities that precipitate itching & rashes, whether they occur without any activity as well, whether you have any other medical conditions, whether you are taking any other medicines on regular basis, whether you have any other allergies, etc. etc. However, from your history, I would first think of what we call "Cholinergic urticaria". It is not exactly due to "allergy", rather it is due to some physical factors which causes rashes and itching. Were I treating you, I would suggest you as follows:1. Please avoid exercises and activities causing excessive sweating, if possible.2. Please avoid bathing in hot water, sauna baths, exposure to hot temperatures, etc. However, if any of these does not cause you symptoms, you can continue with it.3. I would suggest you to avoid hot beverages, alcohol and hot-spicy foods as much as possible.4. If you are having mental/emotional stress, I would suggest you regular meditation and stress reduction techniques as it also can be aggravating your symptoms.5. If you are not comfortable with cetirizine, I would personally suggest you to take ketotifen, which works better for these types of urticaria.6. Please do not scratch when you itch, it will only aggravate itching. You can apply lotion on itchy areas. An important thing I want to mention here is please do not think of "addiction" of antihistamines. These types of urticaria usually last for several years. So as long as you have symptoms, you need to take antihistamines like cetirizine. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Thank you & Regards.
Hi you're having electric shock like sensation along the spine n this increases on coughing n sneezing. This all happened after playing basket ball. Probably I suspect this to be a kind of articular or neurogenic pain caused secondary to injury to the spine which would have resulted in cervical disc prolapse causing spinal cord compression. For this u need to take absolute bed rest for 3-5 days, wear a hard cervical collar n take medications like tab Myosins 1 tab twice daily for 5 days n tab antacid one tab before breakfast for 5 days. If it doesn't Susie consult a neurosurgeon n he will advise u an X-ray cervical spine n if you require an MRI if u have any weakness or continuing pain.

Allergy tests may be needed in case an allergic reaction is suspected. Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards,

Hello. Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor Since you seem to have a generalized involvement with psoriasis; this type of involvement is also known as erythrodermic psoriasis Or unstable psoriasis. This type of psoriasis involvement is associated with thermoregulatory as well as metabolic complications as a result of the lack of normal temperature regulatory functions of the skin as well as loss of proteins, and fluids from the skin. In general unstable forms of psoriasis like erythrodermic, pustular psoriasis is managed conservatively with topical emollients and Oral / Systemic Immunosuppressive like Methotrexate, Cyclosporin etc. Before starting on PVA, patients skin is tested for the tolerable effective dose of PVA, known as MED (minimal erythema dose). The starting dose of PVA is then calculated as 75% of MED. However, if all the skin is already red, there cannot be an accurate determination of MED. Therefore, if inadvertent higher doses of PVA are given in erythrodermic psoriasis without calculating MED, PVA can further irritate the skin and therefore is not the first choice amongst dermatologist in unstable psoriasis. Nevertheless, PVA can be given in low doses along with other systemic treatment like methotrexate, cyclosporin etc. even in erythrodermic psoriasis. Regards
Hi. Stopping ingestion of L-tryptophan or any other agent that may be the offending factor is key in the treatment of eosinophilia-myalgia syn Chat Doctor. Because of the protean manifestations of EMS, patients are treated based on their symptoms. Chronic symptoms, such as muscle pain, spasm, weakness, neuropathy, and skin thickening, are noninflammatory and are treated symptomatically. Intermittent use of muscle relaxants and analgesics. In addition, prednisone is commonly prescribed because inflammation plays a role. However, treatment with corticosteroids is not beneficial in reducing the severity or duration of symptoms. Long-term steroid therapy has no role. Assistance with activities of daily living can be taken. You can consult neurologist for your multiple problems. Hope this is helpful. Take care.

Hi Edition, Thank you for your query. Your symptoms sound very frustrating. It sounds like you have developed chronic sinusitis, or chronic allergic rhinitis.

Hello, I often prescribe an antibiotic when I extract a tooth, but not always. If the extraction was complicated or the patients medical history raises some concern about healing ability, I will prescribe an antibiotic. I often prescribed an antibiotic prior to removal to control the spread of an active infection or for a very symptomatic tooth.  Pain medication and anti-inflammatory medication may be adequate. Should of painful situation arise 3 to 4 days after an extraction, I would be concerned about a Chat Doctor. I would suggest a second opinion if your concern is whether the tooth should be extracted. There may be an option to save the tooth. You could ask the current dentist if there is any other option for this tooth. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my answer is helpful to you. I would be glad to provide additional answers if you provide additional details or have more questions.

Hello, and I hope I can help you today. I am sorry that your breasts have developed such a painful condition. You are correct that you may have breast hypertrophy, which is abnormal growth of the breasts, due to the hormones of pregnancy. Gigantomastia describes breasts that increase in size by 2.5Â kg or greater. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments for breast hypertrophy, especially during pregnancy. Hormonal medications really do not work, and elective surgery is not recommended until at least a year after the baby is born, as sometimes the size of the breast does go down on its own. In the meantime, ice packs and supportive, stretch bras, even when you sleep, can help with the discomfort. Limiting your overall weight gain will also help slow down breast growth, as a significant portion of breast tissue is fat. Applying lots of lotion and emollients to the skin will help reduce stretch marks. I am sorry that there is no immediate treatment for your condition, but your breasts may slow in growth as the pregnancy progresses. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,

Viral hepatitis can be caused by any one of six identified hepatitis viruses ? They are A, B, C, D, E and G. All cause the liver to become inflamed, which interferes with its ability to function normally. All of these viruses cause Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in the acute phase. These return to normal as the liver recovers and the time range is 2 weeks to 3 months normally. It may be more in the case of weaker/ aged individuals. Depending on which virus causes the hepatitis the blood test report will vary. Hepatitis A (causes acute viral hepatitis-Jaundice) is usually a self limiting disease which resolves without any medication. Diet and rest are the important parts of treating it. The antibody (HAD antibody) is not a routinely done test in India. If the antibody test is done, it can show a positive result for up to a period of about 6 months. The infections caused by Hepatitis B or C are more chronic and dangerous and tests are done to detect them. Certain antibody blood test will show up positive for these two viruses even post cure.

Hi welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your query and concern. Blocked renal arteries can be due to elevated blood pressure. This needs adequate timely investigative protocol. Curative stenosis can be due to Inuit stenting procedures. I advise you to have a baseline 2 dimensional echocardiography, ECG and lipid profile to assess the basic cardiac reserve of your heart.

Make sure you get enough liquids, if you are hypertensive under treatment you should check the therapy with your cardiologist and at last if this happens again you should do a Doppler Ultrasound of your lower extremities. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.
Hi, thank you for providing the brief history. As you had a past injury of spine this swelling cannot be related to the back injury. This is more of a systemic pathology and needs a thorough clinical examination and diagnostic test post that. Due to weakness of the cardiac system or kidney issues this kind of swelling is assumed and without any Thorough clinical examination and diagnostic tests it will be tough to mention. Also, this is not a direct injury to the joint so mostly can be systemic. Keeping the leg elevated and improving your physical activities should help reduce the swelling. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor.
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, and thanks for your query. I understand your concern. Unfortunately to help you find a solution to your sleeping problem, I require more information like whether you are over weight or obese, snore at night etc. The pain between the breasts especially if it is burning and more at night, is suggestive of HERD a provoker for asthma. Sleep apnea is a common cause of improper sleep at night.  Nocturnal exacerbation of asthma also makes one sleepless. Take care,
Dear patient thank you for your question. Before we begin treatment we have to diagnose your condition. It can be tricky to diagnose back problems such as the ones you have described without imaging so my first and foremost advise to you is to get an x-ray/ct scan done. The condition to me seems to be lumbar spondylosis. Therefore, while I cannot treat you online without knowing exactly what you have here been some suggestion which should benefit you.1) Take flexion Mr 500Â mg thrice a day. It contains a muscle relaxant which will decrease your spasms. It is contraindicated if you have a liver disease2) Gels will not have a major effect in this situation, so it is useless to use them. I suggest hot fomentation therapy for your back3) I will stress again it is imperative that you show yourself to the orthopedic surgeon at the earliest as a condition like this could progress and result in complications like loss of bowel and bladder movement and pain down your leg etc. I wish you all the best
Hi I can understand your concern... You probably here having hepatitis infection. So omitting is common symptom as constitutional symptom.... Viral marker done... Here is advised regarding diet.....

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your daughter s situation and problem. In my opinion, you should get done chest x-ray of her to rule out lower respiratory tract infection (LETI). LETI (pneumonia) is common after bronchitis and cold. She is also having high grade fever, plenty of mucus expectoration, crackling sound from chest and lower back pain. All these favor possibility of pneumonia more. So consult pediatrician and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x-ray. And start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter. Thanks.
HiT hank you for your question. The treatment of cervical stenosis and myelopathy (spinal cord involvement) depends on signs and symptoms in addition to MRI. It would have been helpful to know the current symptoms. However, it is difficult to imagine having no symptoms with such an advanced stenosis picture. For the findings you have described unfortunately medicines won't help. When symptoms are progressive surgery is the only solution. Moreover, earlier the surgery better would be the outcome. The problem of cervical myelopathy is always progressive. Finding of myelomalacia indicates some damage to spinal cord has already occurred, and the cord must be decompressed surgically as early as possible to prevent further worsening. Also, risk of getting weakness in arms and legs is high even with a trivial fall or trauma to neck. Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Wishing the best outcome.
I am not sure whether I should add Chat Doctor.  But appearance of lumps on your shins raises obviously whether you are noticing what we call as herald sign of underlying systemic or autoimmune disease. You should recognize a fact that skin is eminently involved in such processes as most characteristic presentations. Your doctor is right in advising you to wait and allow time for more obvious changes to appear that guide the blood test and possible need of removal of indicative piece of lumpy skin for histologic confirmation. Please co-operate and arrive at confirmed diagnosis.
Hi.the pain what you have described is very typical of appendicitis which starts at umbilicus (belly button) and goes to right Iliad fossa (right lower abdomen).this type of pain may be very sharp and may be associated with nausea, vomiting, fever and sometimes diarrhea. Since the pain is now 2 weeks old it might have gone to subacute appendicitis. Other possibilities are colitis, Nickels diverticulitis. Your previous episode seems to be a different one. So my advice is got yourself examined and investigated by a surgeon as early as possible to come to a diagnosis and treatment accordingly. Hoped I have helped you.
Hello there, Scorpion stings are managed well with a local application of a baking soda (NAHCO3) paste to neutralize the acid in its venom. You can have tabbed cetirizine once a day for 3 days and also take Cronin 500 m.g twice a day after food for 3 days to manage the pain and tingling. Sometimes the scorpions' stinger may get embedded in your skin. In such cases you may need to visit a doctor and get it removed. The way to tell if its embedded is if you have no relief of symptoms even after applying the soda paste and taking the Chat Doctor. Hope this helps, please feel free to add
Hello. I just read through your question. What you are describing is consistent with an abscess. The location is very common for this type of thing. An abscess is a bacterial infection of the skin. It often produces pus. Antibiotics almost always work. However, when they don't, removing the abscess is necessary. This is commonly done by a surgeon. Whether it heals by antibiotic or heals by removal, it is not a tumor, and is nothing to worry about.
Hello, i can understand your concern. Symptoms like fever, feeling tired, body aches all suggest a viral infection. While testing a flu, we usually do not do tests for each and every strain. So even if the flu test turns negative it can be a due to a new strain. Any viral fever would take a week time to recover fully. Donor pain if you have mild fever, body aches. It would clear on its own. Take paracetamol for fever and a multi vitamin tablet. Chat Doctor.

Hi. Oral prednisone is very useful in allergies as it ceases the inflammatory response to the allergen almost instantaneously. It is necessary to taper steroids only if they have been taken for more than 14 days since that is the duration required by the body to start getting dependent on an external source of steroid (Hypothalami pituitary axis). A 5-day course of steroid can be stopped abruptly without any foreseeable complications. Do keep in mind that high doses of prednisone may affect your vision so do see your physician who started you on these if you develop blurring of vision or changes in color. High steroid doses may also make you vulnerable to infections so try to avoid anything that exposes you to a source of infection. A 5-day course of steroids is usually nothing to be concerned about. Follow up with your physician for the remaining management of your allergies. Do let me know if you have any other questions.

Dear Madam, I have gone through your history and do empathize with your feelings. Early pregnancy loss most of the time could be due to chromosomal abnormalities. However, your karyotyping is normal. I would advise you to report to a foeto-maternal specialist to get yourself evaluated thoroughly for any other possible cause. Thyroid dysfunction, particularly low function of thyroid also may cause such pregnancy wastage. I do not see this investigation performed in your list. Please get your blood examined for T3, T4 and TSH. If hypothyroidism is detected, Levothyroxine is the medicine of choice. I hope this will help you.

Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Go for walking after meals. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in your bed. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand you concern. You have not mentioned your age and sex. The symptoms you have mentioned are also too many and without any chronology. Still I will try to help you in the best possible way. Your most important problem seems to be lymph nodes in jaw line which are painful while swallowing. You have also mentioned soreness in chest, coughing of blood and mucus and blood in stools. These symptoms are suggestive of some serious illness like cancer of throat, chest or elsewhere in body, Tuberculosis or other infection in chest. Some disorder of immunity can also be there. I advise you to immediately contact ER. They may subject you to investigations like blood count, urine and stool test, CT of head, neck and chest, USG of abdomen to arrive at the diagnoses. I hope this will be helpful. Take care.
Hello, I will try to offer you some assistance concerning your mouth. I do not believe your teeth have been affected by your exposure. You are suffering from a severe reaction that has caused a great deal of inflammation. This may affect the soft tissue inside you mouth if exposed to any oils of these plants. Simply, inflamed tissue can equal sensitive teeth. Pain medication may help while the amount of inflammation is great. First, make sure you are not getting continued exposure to these plants and oils? Change your toothbrush and anything you may have touched which may carry the oil. There are some endocrine gels or rinses that you could try for your mouth. Switch to a toothpaste for sensitive teeth. These have a chemical that blocks the tubules on the roots of your teeth to reduce sensitivity. Avoid an acidic diet. I believe there is a relationship between these plants and some foods: mangos and cashews. You need to give this time to heal. Rashes can easily last two weeks. Return to your doctor if you feel your symptoms are getting worse to see if you need more medication. Ben Chat Doctor.  Topical solutions for your skin are available that can help you reduce the itchy feeling. I hope you will find some of these suggestions useful, and I wish you a quicker recovery. Please keep your doctor updated on your progress and plan to see a dentist if your teeth do not start to feel better for a clinical evaluation.

I hope this helps
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thank you for your query.

Hello, Thanks for writing in. The fact that you had marina coil earlier too and got it replaced rules out any adverse reaction to the coil itself. You could also get an ultrasound scan to be sure that the coil is in place. Since you have had kidney transplant, your immunity may be little weaker than in normal individuals. Fungal infections are not picked up on routine sexually transmitted infection tests. This can result in fungal infection in your vagina which is causing the irritation. I suggest you apply some antifungal medication as suggested by your gynecologist. Hope this helps.

Hello, For blurred vision, numbness in arms and concentration difficulty, a neurologist clinical examination is advised. You may have to under MRI brain and Cervical spine for ruling out the possible causes.  As you mentioned the Bone spur protruding from the upper spine into the brain, I suspect there might be some neurological deficits which may trouble the vision and tingle as well due to compression onto the neurological tissue.  Since you are 55, I will advise for the neurologist opinion and medication followed by that.  Also, physiotherapy management for the neck and shoulder which will help your RCI and also the Numbness.  Blurred vision will be corrected once the compression of the spur is reduced over the neurological tissue by strength in the muscles. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Jay In Chat Doctor.

Swelling is often in the lower area of the body like legs and ankle during hanging position because of gravity. Other reasons why sweeping and red spots appear could be any peripheral disorder like DVT, sometimes when BP raises high you suffer from edema and itchiness because of which red spots appear. So in such case let me recommend you to please take some precautions and if it appears again then immediately contact some doctor to rule out the exact reason by various investigation procedures:1. Try to elevate your legs whenever you are lying down, to a position above your heart.2. Immediately do some ice massage over the area.3. Perform some calf exercises so that blood circulation is maintained.4. Wear stockings during your travel.5. Wear loose fitting clothing.6. Do not sit in one position for long. Try to change position frequently.7. Avoid a position in which you have to hang your legs.8. In office place small still under your foot while sitting and change the positions so that your leg does not come directly in against gravity position as there are chances of increase in sweeping. Please follow the above instructions/treatment. If still there is no relief then as an advice please visit some nearby doctor for investigation as there may be chances of DVT or any thrombotic problem. Good Luck and Get Well Soon

Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Rabies is a disease transmitted by bit of the dog which is 100% fatal, but it is 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment. As you were bitten by a dog three days ago and the bite is very tiny and is healing without any signs of infection suggest that there is no open wound.

Take antacids because sometimes the acidity also might present with similar complaints.Don't lie down immediately after dinner. Finish the dinner 2 hours before sleeping.

Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Well, after the EKG and stress tests came back normal, we can exclude, with the highest probability, a rhythm or conduction disturbance which could be innate. It is important to be stressed that heart rate tends to increase whenever any human being is engaging in physical activity - it is normal to go up to 200 beats per minute in your daughters case, or is undergoing to a state with psychological stress. If that is so, then there is nothing to worry about. Also, the pain originating in the right part of the chest and then radiating to the right arm is not linked with the palpitations, and very rarely, with any heart condition. My opinion is that repeated palpitations generate certain amounts of anxiety and the anxiety produces really-felt symptoms by the subject complaining about them, but with no organic or disease-based origin. My opinion, once again, is that there is nothing to worry about. I hope I was helpful. Take care.
Hello, This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like PSV or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holder monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation. Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. Ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Is there any stress or anxiety associated. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day. If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiologist studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases.
Dear user, Thank you for writing to us. I understand your concern about burning pain after ejaculation. This suggests possibly inflammation of the structures near the urine tube like prostate or other sex organs.

Use barrier methods (condom) during sex with your partner. If your partner has any symptoms like burning, discharge or itching, then she does require treatment. Wish you good health.

I have understood your concern, as you mentioned your pain is recurrent in nature and this indicate that your muscles are weak not enough to provide proper strengthen to spinal segments and main thing is your siting and laying posture may give rise to chronic long term recurrent pain. You need to correct the posture. Bulge may due disc impingement at spinal level. Patches may give you pain relief but temporary. So my suggestion is to relive pain and stiffness at spinal vertebral level, you have to take physiotherapy treatment in form of IT modalities and ultrasound treatment for localized tenderness is very useful. Only physical therapy can cure problems permanently, need to take strengthening exercises with physical therapist learn many exercises which helps to give stability at spinal column. I hope you have satisfied with the answer.

Ultrasound taken within 1st trimester i.e., within 12 weeks of pregnancy helps in accurate estimation of age of pregnancy, the well-being of concepts and also for the accurate dating of pregnancy. So I suggest you to go for ultrasound. And also rule out any thyroid abnormalities, progesterone insufficiency, any genetic anomalies etc. which are the causes of first trimester miscarriage. Nothing to worry. Relax. Take healthy nutritional diet and folic acid supplements. Avoid physical strain and intercourse. Hope this helps. Best regards...

Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, molds, pollen, insect proteins, animal dander (if you have pet), etc. As you have morning symptoms more often, I would first think of indoor allergens like house dust mites, molds and insect proteins. This will help you identify the substance causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.2. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long duration. Please note that Immunotherapy takes time to become most effective. It gradually reduces your requirement of medications.3. For symptom relief, I would suggest you combination of montelukast and levocetirizine which will reduce your allergy symptoms.4. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards.

Hence, you need to be clinically evaluated by Physician first followed by Liver function test done in the laboratory for confirmation. Based on the results, you would be appropriately treated. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.

Also, a urine test to figure out if it is indicating any particular injury. There is a possibility of anything but to mention a few -1. Stress fracture.2. Gouty arthritis3. Lumbar disc herniation4. Inflammation of the fascia, etc this are just few to mention. But to take care at home you need to first do hot water fermentation as it will improve the blood supply and dilate the pain from there. Post doing Hot water fermentation you can do some exercises for the feet like - picking the marbles from the floor with toes, picking the bits of paper, performing ankle toe movements as well. If the pain is subsided by this some home care activities it is well and good. Incase if it is not subsided than you need to a urine test, an x-ray and later if required an MRI. The better the sooner. Prevention is better than cure. Also see if you have any issues with the footwear. In fact most of the time the gait cycle can reveal that on what aspect of the foot you are applying too much weight. Well, I hope I have answered your query I feel. With the grace of God I wish you a speedy recoveryRegardsJay In Chat Doctor.
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Tuberculosis after treatment heals by either fibrosis or calcification. And both these produce permanent scar tissue on chest x-ray. So for your query, I advise you to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax 2. Bronchoscopy and BAD (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. CT thorax is much more informative than chest x-ray in lung scar. Broncos copy and BAD is more superior to rule out tuberculosis. If both these are negative for tuberculosis then you can argue with visa authority about not having active, infectious disease. Your right upper lobe densities are only old, healed, inactive lesions. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
HiT hanks for posting on ChatDoctorJaundice can be a symptom of liver disorders or infections. Since he is responding positively to treatment, changing the hospital may not be the best option. Since it has be established that jaundice is due to liver infection, I will suggest you discuss your financial situation with your Doctor. Depending on the number of days of hospital treatment he has had, your Doctor may send him home on oral relay treatment depending on the type of liver infection. Regular reviews may be planned, and he will be followed up from the house. I will advise he takes enough water as well. Hope my answer will help you Best regards
The bluish coloration as you have described may occur when there is deoxygenated blood -that is blood with less oxygen in it. This condition in medical terms is called CYANOSIS (cyan meaning bluish). Since our heart is the pump that supplies us with oxygenated blood, the first step in a child with cyanosis would be to get the heart checked. Your doctor has correctly referred you to a cardiologist as this is the first step. Certain heart problems require a cardiologists' expertise. They would probably do a test called Echocardiogram to get a better view of the detailed working of the chambers, valves etc. of the heart.  Not all cardiac diseases present with chest pain or breathing problems. Some have mild symptoms and some do not have any symptoms. The elevation of the white blood cell count since it is marginal may or may not be significant. Medical care is very advanced in the 21st century & there is a solution for almost all problems. Warmest regards
Hi, Thank you for providing the brief history of you. Also, a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. As, you have pain in the posterior aspect of the chest cage, it could be a muscle spasm, since due to performing some physical activity, this could have occurred. Since you did not mention anything about the cold, cough etc., I do not think it will be a lung pathology. So, looks more of a muscular pain, which needs an attention. Undergoing physical therapy assessment and post that, Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should reduce your pain. As, pain level reduces, the therapist will teach the exercises. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

Hi, When there is foul smelling discharge from one side only, and you are seeing something sponge like (sometimes this may be just an enlarged or inflamed turbinate from rhinitis), there is high chance of a foreign body being lodged there, causing secretions to pool up and secondary infection with foul smell. If no foreign body, this indicated rhinitis. Kindly get it examined by your doctor. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Hi, Thanks for posting your query at Chat Doctor. First, I would like you to mention, stress usually does not cause inflammation in the region of the incisive papilla. After reading your symptoms I feel that you may have injured/scraped that region due to something hard in your food. If you keep touching the area with either your tongue or your finger, it can lead to interruption in healing resulting in inflammation and pain on probing. I would recommend you to apply any good topical anesthetic ointment in the area 2-3 times/day. Do not aggregate the lesion by touching it. It should resolve in a day or two. If the problem does not resolve, you should visit a dentist for oral examination. Hope you feel better soon. Regards
Hi, Thank you providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned you met an accident and have injured 5 ribs, and you have on bruising over your thigh and swelling of right leg. Since you mentioned you have numbness and burning sensation over the right thigh it could be healing of the soft tissue of the skin. But to ask, have you taken any x-ray or MRI of the lumbar spine. As usually in RTA one shouldn't ignore spine. Any injury to spine is initially undetected and later gives symptoms. So I will recommend taking that.Also, to advice you, is to perform regular breathing exercises. There are types of it and a physical therapist can teach you.- Deep breathing- Purse lip breathing-Costal Breathing-Abdominal breathing.- Coughing and Huffington - perform all exercises by placing the hand over the injured ribs. As it will restrict the mobility of the ribs and will not interfere in healing.Also, this breathing exercises will help you gain strength in the muscles of respiration and also the abdominal muscles. Post this kindly do some simple upper limb and lower limb exercises to keep the joint mobility maintained and also the muscle property. Muscles should not go into wasting. Also you need to keep the right leg over the pillow when you are lying down to remove the metabolic waste. Due to metabolic waste the healing can be delayed to its better to focus on each corner. Later on once Your ribs turns out to be good, slowly progress to core stability and spine stretching so in future you will have a good and strong spine. As you must have noticed about the professional riders they all have a good abs, it is because to have a strong spine. Spine is the important segment of the human body which connects the upper and lower half of the body. Later on you will be focussing on lower limb strengthening as the best, so the weaker muscle becomes strong, and you have a strong regain. Also, if possible kindly take an MRI just to have a doubt clear that the spine is safe. The symptoms of burning and numbness can be because of it, so for ruling out this one doubt its on a safer side to get it done. I hope to see you soon with your motorcycle again. With the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery regards
Hello, Let me divide the symptom first. For the speech, I think you need to check this out with the neurologist is there is any higher motor function or cranial nerve involvement. Only after an MRI and clinical examination, we can comment over this. Coming to your other symptoms like - numbness, pain, tingling, etc. which is radiating in nature I suspect this to be a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine. Due to which there are the symptoms present. Doing core stability exercises, spinal muscle strengthening exercises and lower limbs as a whole for strengthening will help improve the symptoms to reduce. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Pericarditis is less likely in your case.  Because your ECG, d dimer and CT scan is normal. Pericarditis if present, you must have elevated d dimer, characteristic ECG abnormality and CT scan positivity. So no need to worry much for Pericarditis. In my opinion you are having anxiety and related symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. Avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright.

Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. The pus on the lingual side of lower teeth can be due to tooth or gum infection. Check if there is any cavity in corresponding teeth. Or if you had any trauma to lower teeth, any toothbrush injury or calculus. I suggest you to visit a dentist and get an x-ray done.

Both are minor procedures, usually done under local anesthesia. Do warm saline rinses. This will help in Chat Doctor.  Your dentist will prescribe you antibiotics and painkillers. Brush twice daily. Take healthy diet, vitamins, minerals. Hope the answer helps you. Thank you!

Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The soreness over the gum and the alveolar ridge could be an ulcer secondary to the use of tobacco. It can be a leukoplakia or erythroplakia or ulcerative lesion. Consult an oral physician to get these things ruled out. If the lesion does not heal in 2 weeks then get it biopsied to rule out cancer. The lesion what you are describing looks like malignant lesions. Immediately stop the habits, take antioxidants like capsule lycopene, and you can take topical anesthetics and analgesic like Anabel gel. Consume a lot of green leafy vegetables and turmeric. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

Hello Ms Re eta, Probably the brain damage following the head injury was too much and so your father has not recovered. Unconsciousness for 20 days following an injury is very long and indicates poor chances of functional recovery. The doctor must have assessed the brain functions by means of examination before communicating to you that it is not functioning properly. The decision to take him home remains with you. There are no medications which can really improve brain function in such situations. Any recovery that occurs is due to the healing of the injury to the brain on its own. Nursing care is most important in such condition. Good luck.
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Infection in the throat if it is not treated properly the infective agents can disseminate to other parts of the body.

I would suggest you to take appropriate antibiotic and control spread of infection to other parts of the body. Thank you.
Hello, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for posting your query. I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through. You have an olfactory hallucination and the first suspicion that one should get on having these hallucinations are1. Local nasal pathology2. Space occupying lesion in the brain. You first have to get examined from a ENT surgeon to see if there is any local nasal pathology leading to this kind of symptoms. If it is normal then you should go ahead with CT scan brain to identify any SOL in the brain compressing in the olfactory pathway leading to the bad smell. The last possibility is a psychiatric illness causing bad smell. Hope I am able to answer your concerns. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you. If not, you may close the discussion and if possible you may rate the answer for me, so that I get good feedback. In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below-mentioned link:bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.

Hello, The medication is called Fluconazole. Rifleman is the US brand name of a tablet that is swallowed. The medication is available by prescription. Dosage and length of use is determined by your doctor. This can vary and must be confirmed for your circumstances. Fluconazole may be given as a liquid, tablet or capsule.

Hello, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that it is necessary evaluate her heart function and exclude possible heart failure, which may mimic this clinical situation.Gastroesophageal reflux may mimic this situation too, although the dizziness is not typical of this disorder. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing a cardiac ultrasound and NT-pro BNP levels to investigate for heart failure. Other tests to consider would be:- A chest X-ray study-Blood electrolytes- Kidney and liver function tests would also recommend trying an anti-acid or PPI (Omeprazole, Pantoprazole, et cetera). If her symptoms improve, a fibro-gastroscopy may be necessary. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
His have gone through the detail, and it is a CSE of refractory seizure. EEG test can show false positive or false negative result. I would like to know was the MRI done with epilepsy protocol as standard MRI brain may also show no abnormality. There is one modality called MRI with epilepsy protocol in which emphasis is given to find out the cause of epilepsy like medial temporal epilepsy or conical dysplasia. These condition needs to be treated surgically if not controlled by medication. I would like to add topiramate which is a very good medication particularly for refractory seizures. Thanks and regards

Hello. I fully understand the complexity of your situation. It is not easy to do right step without consent. But I agree that CSF leakage is major risk factor for meningitis.

Hello! Thank you for the query. Lower abdominal pain can be caused by several diseases including: urinary bladder infection, urinary bladder stones, uterine or ovarian infection, ectopic pregnancy, inguinal hernia and many more. If your symptoms are associated with burning when urinating it can be urinary tract problem, if your pain aggravates when laughing and the pain is localized in one side groin it can be inguinal hernia. As the pain itself does not suggest any of these diseases, the very first step for you should be physical examination by your doctor.

Hello! Thank you for the query. First you need to calm down as this does not sound like a cancer. However, you need to look closer to your symptoms and have some diagnostics. If you do suffer from constipation for years, have had blood or mucus in stool and lost some weight recently, you should have colonoscopy performed. Your hemorrhoids might need some surgery which can also set you free from stenosis.

From the way you describe your symptoms, in my opinion I am more inclined to believe that you might be having Generalized Anxiety Disorder. But before coming to that diagnosis, I would want to evaluate your heart and vascular function. I would like to know if you are diabetic, hypertensive, smoking, under constant emotional stress. The reason I would want to know this is that these are risk factors to develop heart disease later, and so they are to be treated now. An ECG may be done though it is most likely that you would have a normal one, but it is better to confirm it. Having a family history of heart disease DOES NOT make you 100% likely to get heart disease. It is possible that you may never get it too. Once I am sure that your heart is normal I would suggest you to meet a psychiatrist who routinely treats Generalized Anxiety Disorder. There are several behavioral therapies that may help you apart from Chat Doctor.  Some of the medicines that may use include fluoxetine, paroxetine citalopram, buspirone. Since these are prescription medicines, it is best you consult the psychiatrist. I hope this helps.

Hello, Make sure you have taken the prescription medication as prescribed.  Chat Doctor.  Avoid taking an antacid with a two-hour period of taking this medication.

If you have delayed healing, your dentist may need to clean out the socket place a medicated paste into the extraction socket. Try switching to Tylenol for pain relief. This may be kinder to your stomach than the ibuprofen. Avoid irritants such as acidic and spicy foods. Follow good nutrition and balanced vitamins especially vitamin B to assist healing.

Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. But don't worry.I'll try to explain you something and give you some advises. You might experience fast, and strong heart beats for different reasons. It may be a simple sinus tachycardia. This mean that your heart beats over 100 beats for minute. Its normal range in resting situation is between 60-100 beat for minute. This might happen from different reasons from simple emotional stores to different pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. You may feel strong heart beats because of extrasistoles.These is electrical impulses that generates from different parts of the heart different from that of a normal sinus rhythm. This houses an ectopic, escaped beat and you feel like a beat is skipping, and the other one is stronger causing difficulties in breathing fully and sometimes a cough. The extrasistolic beats might happen for the same reasons as sinus tachycardia. Sometimes in young ages or in stressed periods these are quite normal, and they come ang go. But if your heart beats very fast suddenly and in a chaotic, irregular way it might be what we call an atrial fibrillation. This is an arrhythmia when the heart doesn't beat in a normal sinus rhythm. You might experience paroxysmal episodes when your heart jumps from normal rhythm to fibrillation and vise- versa. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend you to make some simple examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia or hypothyroidism, an electrocardiogram,echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring for 24-48 hours. This will tell as your rhythm tendency. You have nothing to worry, but I will recommend this check up if these symptoms begin to interfere with your normal healthy live. At mean time avoid coffee and caffeine products because they rise your heart frequency or extra systoles. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards.
Dear sir, it could mean many things, but I think that there shouldn't be any relation between your gallbladder removal and this symptom. It sounds for me more like typical colon disorder; IBD, Crohn or ulcers colitis, infective colitis etc. The best way to rule it out is to do colonoscopy. After that you can plan further tests. Blood in stool can also be serious sign of some benign(polyps, haemorrhoids, fissuea) as well as malignant diseases so don't be very concerned but do colonoscopy definitely. Wish you good health,

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of either bronchitis or Pulmonary embolism is more. Birth control pills can cause Pulmonary embolism. So in my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test) 2. CT Pulmonary Angiography. PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need additional inhaled bronchodilators and oral bronchodilators also.  CT Pulmonary Angiography is needed to rule out Pulmonary embolism. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

But you can take some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Don't over exert yourself after follicles rupture.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 cycles.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.

Hello, Your symptoms are pointing towards possibility of nerve compression in the cervical spine with articular pain in left upper limb.  Neck stiffness can be due to muscle spasm.  Possibility of heart involvement is less likely. I WOULD LIKE to advise X-ray of cervical spine anteroposterior and lateral views to check for cervical lordosis. If it is lost muscle spasm is likely cause.  Treatment is muscle relaxant like relax Mr 8 mg twice a day for 5 days. Avoid using large and hard pillows. Soft cervical collar application also helps in pain relief. Tab regain x 75 mg one at bedtime for reducing pain in left upper limb. If this is not helping MRI for the cervical spine and visit to orthopedic surgeon is recommended.  Hope I have answered your query. Take care

Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, The intervertebral discs are cartilaginous structures present between vertebrae. The disc acts as lubricant for smooth motion of the vertebral bodies during movement of the spine. At times the disc starts bulging out from its normal position. The bulging disc starts impinging nerve roots which emanate from the spinal cord. The nerve emanate through small foramina in the vertebral bodies. These foramina are intact in your case. In your case, discs are bulging at the level of L4-L5 and L5-S1. Due to the compression, the area supplied by these nerves are affected. This is responsible for the pain and numbness in the foot region. The S1 nerve does not supply the genital region. The treatment for this condition is complete bed rest. If the condition does not improve on bed rest, surgical measures may be required. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.
Cellophane you for posting on Chat Doctor. From your description, it seems you are having atrophic scars due to chickenpoxScars are pretty challenging to treat and treatment comes with variable results. More importantly the fact is no topical medications are going to help in removing scars. Only retinoid or glycolic acid based creams can help to some extent, but the results are very subtle and unpredictable and works for very mild scars only. Therefore, I would suggest you to go for laser therapy (Fractional Co2 laser, Non-ablative RF etc.) as it has the best results of all other treatment modalities. Moreover, if additionally treated with dermaroller or 100%TCA peel (CROSS technique), pretty appreciable results can be achieved. Hope this will take care of your query. If you wish to contact me in future for any query kindly use the following link:http://doctor.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor. Thank you
Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. High creatinine level indicates kidney dysfunction, not always kidney failure. It may be acute or temporary dysfunction due to some reason, or it may be chronic pr permanent kidney dysfunction. Do basic urine report, Check BP and do CT scan or sonography.

Consult your nearby nephrologist, or you can get back to me with above reports. I think this would be helpful to you. Best wishes. TC. Chat Doctor.
Hi, The hair growth pattern in the scalp is unlikely to be due to an aneurysm. This you have an open injury to the scalp that caused scarring and therefore the hair there is different?

Hello According to your history of travel, this bump around the anal ring is hemorrhoid, not a boil (because of undue force for stool). Since you develop this, so next DON'T STRAIN at all, usually straining (force) aggravate the condition. For this the best way is taken some phenolphthalein tablet for constipation during journey. For this take some an ovate type cream (or nifedipine +local anesthetic cream). I don't advise any antibiotics to my patient. In my opinion consult a physician and get a conservative treatment for hemorrhoids (2nd opinion). Good luck.

Answer e) is correct. During active stretch excitation of gamma efferent neutrons of anterior gray column of spinal cord produces contraction of polar regions of the intro fugal fibers and there by not contractile equatorial regions of nuclear bag and chain fibers are actively stretched. This results in excitation of alpha motor neurons through the monosynaptic loop of stretch reflex consequently the extra fugal fibers of the corresponding muscle are contracted until it shortens to equal with the degree of contraction of muscle spindle. This method of contraction of skeletal muscle maintains its residual length. The alpha and gamma motor neurons are excited simultaneously by the pyramidal tract, the alpha neurons being the fast conductors initiate muscle contraction without limit of shortening and the gamma neurons through the reflex loop maintain muscle contraction with desired length.
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your friends situation and problem. Treatment of tuberculosis is long, for at least 6-8 months. So recovery is also delayed. Usually recovery is expected after 2 months of regular treatment. Tuberculosis causes pleurisy (inflammation of pleura). And this causes chest pain and arm pain. She is on treatment since 1 month and so it is very early to see improvement. In my opinion, she should take treatment for 1 more month because usually 2 months are required for clinical and symptomatic improvement in tuberculosis. If after 2 months, she is still having pain than get done chest x-ray and sputum report to rule out Chat Doctor.  But at present, wait for 1 more month. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing her good health. Thanks.

Remain in same position after sex for half an hour.  - artificial insemination (using your husbands' semen) Thanks.
Dear Mr. Goal, At best, stem cell therapy is experimental in nature. I would be unable to either recommend it to you or deter you from going ahead. You should visit a stem cell therapy center and meet the doctor first and resolve all the doubts before you go ahead with it. You should note that the same thing applies to ch elation therapy for autism. Beware of money-making rackets! Do your own research before submitting your son to an experiment which is likely very expensive. Remember also that autism tends to reduce as the child grows older. I hope you are going to the counselor and their multipronged behavioral remedial therapy!
Thank you for your question. You have provided the information that you are a 57-year-old lady with high BP and acid reflux. Is your BP under control? Are you on any medications for the same? Are you taking any medications for the acid reflux? From the description of our symptoms, it appears that your problems are mainly due to acid reflux. Are the symptoms associated with food intake? Though your symptoms are suggestive of reflux, it would be prudent to visit your physician and get an ECG(or an EKG) done to rule out a problem in the heart. Reducing your stress levels, having food at proper time, and avoiding spicy foods and tea and coffee and too many chocolates, avoiding lying down just after eating food, having dinner about 2 hours before you go to sleep may all help to reduce your reflux symptoms. Medicines are available to effectively suppress reflux, and you may discuss with your physician regarding the same.

Hello dairy condition seems to be related to bruise i.e. grinding your teeth in sleep. This condition hurts your jaw joint in front of your ear and if you get more severe can compress your adjacent nerves, and you might feel tingling or needle prick sensation in mouth.

So just be relaxed, start meditation for at least 10 minutes daily, have lukewarm milk before sleep, and start taking OTC available muscle relaxants or painkillers twice daily. If possible do warm compressions from outside on area in front of your ear. Wait for one week if you feel relaxed then continue this for 1 month otherwise see your dentist.
Hi, Thanks for posting your query. The information you have given is inadequate. With just SGPT report alone, it is difficult to give an opinion. I presume the rest of the liver function test was normal. This SGPT report shows only mild increase and it most often is due to fatty liver. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen may be done to rule out fatty liver. You can get tests done for other causes as well which include tests for hepatitis B and C viral infections. I hope that answers your question. Regards.
Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to a sinus infection.

If these tests result normal, I would recommend trying to switch again to pantoprazole for some days. If this helps improve your situation, it would indicate possible low tolerance to omeprazole. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Wishing good health,
Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you are having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) mostly.

So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start Proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. 7. Avoid alcohol and smoking if you have these habits. 8. Lose weight if you are having obesity. Don't worry, you will be alright.

Once the swelling of the brain reduces, the part of the skull can be replaced. Or instead of the part of skull, a titanium mesh can be kept Now How long it takes for the swollen brain to Come back to normal size ?

Hello, Thank you for posting on ChatDoctorComplexion of any person is having two components; constitutive, one which is predetermined by genetics and racial factors and usually cannot be changed with any treatment. The other component is due to external agents like environmental exposure, sunlight, use of any cosmetics etc. and is amenable to treatment.

Hi! Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. As you mentioned the molar fractured while extraction, are you sure it was not removed entirely? Usually no part of tooth is left in socket intentionally unless it is small enough to resort over a period of time. Still for clarification or if you are having any symptom, I suggest you go to an Oral surgeon and get an X-ray of that area done. It will confirm if It's still there and whether it needs to be removed or not. If it is causing any infection or pain, it needs to be removed. Do not worry, it will be painless under local anesthesia. As you had an unpleasant dental experience once, please don't keep that fear forever and go ahead. Hope the answer helps you. Thank you!

Greetings to u! I'm glad that I will be able to clear your doubt. There is very less possibility that wisdom tooth removal pain lasts for this long unless it is a traumatic extraction. I would also like to point out that the healing time varies with every person. The gum opening up can be because of vigorous gargling resulting in loss of the healing tissue and bone exposure. But this is very uncommon. Next the bone kind of thing and tonsil kind of thing that popped out could be the healing tissue as I've stated before. All these might have resulted in an opening rather communication between his mouth and nose, the reason for his difficulty in blowing his nose. This can be corrected by a small surgical procedure(if required, which has to be decided by your treating dentist/oral surgeon)Till then avoid vigorous gargling, blowing nose, sucking and sneezing. In case of sneezing please close your mouth and nose with your hands. This is not an emergency situation, so be cool. Hope this helped u. Thank u

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, there is no cure for IPF (idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis). It is chronic progressive fibrosis of the lung. Following things should be done to achieve optimal treatment and reduce the rate of worsening of lung functions. 1. Home oxygen therapy. Low dose oxygen should be given continuously for at least 16-18 hours a day. This is the best treatment. 2. Start perfinodone. It is the only available and US FDA approved anti-fibrotic agent. It reduces rate of fibrosis. 3. N acetyl cysteine is having excellent antioxidant, bucolic and expectorant properties. And hence it is beneficial in IPF. 4. Enroll her in Pulmonary Rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are done. These will surely improve her lung functions. 5.

So I feel your need to investigate further to diagnose the exact cause of his breathing problem. One possibility is exercise-induced asthma. You can get a pulmonary function test done for that. Once a proper diagnosis is made then appropriate treatment and its duration can be planned. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Difficulty or soreness during swallowing post wisdom tooth removal can be most probably due to inflammation in throat as wisdom tooth extraction can cause inflammation in soft tissues in the extraction site and due to proximity of throat there is inflamed in throat too.

Hi there,First, I'd like to reassure you that your liver enzymes are only slightly elevated, and this doesn't mean that you have liver failure or your liver is in any immediately danger. I think some medications you've taken in the past are probably contributing to your elevated liver numbers, but I think they can go back to normal with the proper care.  The first thing I would do is stop all your ayurvedic medications, which I think you have done.  Time is the treatment here, and your liver will heal itself with time. I also would stay away from alcohol, fatty foods, and stay well HY Chat Doctor.  I'd also limit red meat if possible.  I wouldn't lose hope here. I see plenty of people with liver problems, and many times the liver can heal itself by clean living.  Furthermore, I don't think you're in any big trouble here. I'd just stay away from the medications, eat and live clean, and take care of yourself with diet and exercise. I really do think you'll get better with this advice. I hope this answers your questions. Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions.

Hello, osteoblastomas are commonly associated with pain, but you have mentioned no pain. And osteosarcoma also looks similar to osteoblast which is worse. Get a clear picture of the tumor by consulting an MDS (ORAL PATHOLOGIST). An early diagnosed tumor should be removed before it causes any problem is my suggestion. The loss of teeth can be replaced by prosthesis (artificial teeth). In very rare cases benign osteoblast can turn malignant (difficult to treat), so please visit an oral pathologist as soon as possible and get a clear idea of what to do next. If it is an osteoblast my advice will be to take up the surgery. Wish you a healthy happy life. Take care

Hi, I appreciate your caring towards your wife. Duration of use of the medicines will be told to you by the psychiatrist, and usually it is for 5 years after she is living without any psychotic problems. Stopping medicines before that increases chances of relapse of symptoms. Added will be risk of complications like aggression, suicide and so on. Taking irregularly leads to development of resistance to medicines and need to go for medicines with higher cost and/or side effects. Laws of certain countries ban giving medicines without patients knowledge. It is always better to take her to confidence. Discuss the problems she has taking medicines. If she has any side effects that can be tackled. If she has any apprehension that can be resolved. If she was problem taking tablets, She can opt for alternative methods like syrup or depot. With depot injections she can have injections once in 2-4 weeks and gradually her oral medicine can be stopped. So my advice is to decide on the path by considering her wishes too.
Urostomy doesn't hurt, because It's nothing more than visual inspection by a physician of a patients' urine sample. In other words urostomy is the diagnosis of diseases by inspection of urine.

HiT hanks for your query. I appreciate your concern for the biopsy report.

Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor Your description of the rash and associated pain does seem to suggest a possibility of Shingles; more so if the rash is arranged in a stripe like pattern across one half of the body, with a sharp mid-line cut off. Shingles may initially start either as rash or as raised patches and subsequently may develop fluid filled lesions. Therefore, absence of fluid filled lesions from the start doesn't rule out shingles. Pain is more of a feature of herpes Zoster; irritation to the muscle rub would have been associated with a burning sensation rather than pain. I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. A dermatologist would be better able to confirm it or rule it out. There is usually associated pain which may be shooting or stabbing in quality. If Shingles is confirmed to be shingles on visual inspection, treatment would be with an oral antiviral e.g. acyclovir or val acyclovir. Associated pain also need to be managed appropriately with NSAIDsFirst step would be to visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosisRegards

I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.

Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned you had implanted in the leg and for so long days no pain and aches. So now if the pain is arising then you should get it once checked by taking up an x-ray.

Hello! The nose bleed (medically termed epistaxis)cannot happen because of Pulmonary embolism per se. Embolism means there is clotting of blood in that blood vessel. While what your parent had experienced is bleeding (opposite of clotting) Since you have mentioned that he is on anticoagulant medications (blood thinners) it is possible that these Chat Doctor.  Also, it is possible that this nose bleed could have been initiated by some other cause and aggravated by the blood thinner medications.  In that case the underlying cause (maybe hypertension or trauma to nose or anything else relevant)needs to be looked for and treated. While on the way to physician, to reduce the nose bleed, ask your father to pinch his nose for few seconds and lean forwards, application of ice packs can help to constrict the leaking blood vessels and reduce bleed.

Hello, Sorry to hear that our team in the medical was not able to help you out.  It would have been perfect if you had mentioned the details of the MRI reports as we could have understood something from it. If you have any issue with the intervertebral disc and nerve entrapment. Now since you are mentioning pain in the hip, thigh, leg and back, I would like to know if the pain symptom is radiating in nature?  Also, how is the back pain? Is the nature of the pain sharp shooting or dull aching. If dull aching then it will be related to muscle but if sharpshooting than it will be for nerve. Now coming to an analysis of you, you mentioned your age is 38, so we can look for some Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.  Due to which there might be changes of back pain and nerve getting trapped. For this I will recommend you to try out the exercise for the core, back and lower limbs on both sides.  It is mandatory to do exercise in any back pains or radiating pains as due to pain there is a muscle weakness which gets build up over a period of time and once the muscles are weak there is instability of the spinal column. I wish you check for your blood glucose levels along with uric acid too, so we can have a differential diagnosis made to rule out the possibility because.  If you can still mention in detail about the MRI it will be really kind of you. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, many back cases associated with leg pain are doing well with conservative management. Like - exercise, physical therapy and yoga.  Outcome score is almost as desired to be. Please start the exercise, and you will get a difference in the overall physical well-being. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Jay In Chat Doctor.

Hi Sir/Mam, I can understand your children problem. When ever a tooth decay develops sensitivity, it means the decay has entered second layer of the tooth.

You can wait for one more month taking medications. If again pain and swelling develops you can proceed with root canal treatment. Hope your query is answered. For further queries please don't hesitate to contact me.

Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. The initial management of cervical disc disease is always by conservative management (non-surgical methods) and includes the following -Soft Collar: Soft collar allow the muscles of the neck to rest and limit neck motion. This can help decrease pinching of nerve roots with movement. Soft collars should only be worn for short periods of time, because long-term wear can decrease the strength of neck muscles. Medicines: Analgesic are needed in the acute phase. Muscle relaxants are essential for relieving muscle spasms once the acute pain subsides. Neurotrophic vitamins like METHYLCOBALAMINE (activated It B12) or PREGABALIN will help in alleviating the neuropathic pain. Cervical traction: may enlarge the disc space, permitting the prolapse to subside. Intermittent cervical traction for not more than 30 minutes at a time.

Improving neck strength and flexibility with simple exercises may lessen discomfort and pain.

Thank you for your queryBronchitis is an inflammation of the small airways in your lung. This could be associated with allergies/asthma, infection of the respiratory tract. Secretions develop in response to inflammation and infection. This helps with clearing the airways. Sometimes when there is too much, it enters our larger airways and requires us to cough it out. This process and an inflammation /infection in our throat could cause swelling of the throat and associated structures (ears, nose). The middle ear is connected to the throat by the Eustachian tube, one on either side (This helps to regulate pressure in the ear). The nose is connected to several sinuses (air filled pockets in our face that help to regulate voice). When there is repeated or prolonged increase in pressure in these areas (blowing your nose too hard, coughing, swelling in these areas), it can affect the pressure within the ear and result in tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Ear infections or inner ear pathology may also be associated with tinnitus. Once the bronchitis and associated symptoms are better, the ringing should subside and go away. If this does not happen or if this interferes with your hearing, see an ENT (ear/nose/throat)specialist who can quickly examine you and treat any underlying causes. .hope this helps. Please get back to us if you have any questions. Wish you good health

Hi, Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities. Stress can cause periods to start later than usual, even in women who have had regular periods for years. So that alone doesn't mean that you're pregnant. The fact that several home pregnancy tests have given a negative result points to the conclusion that you aren't pregnant. Yes, a doctors blood test is far more efficient than a home pregnancy test ad you can have one done, but I don't think you're pregnant. You're just getting a late period. I hope this answered your question.

Hi. Thanks for your query. Bruising should not occur as this is not normal to have bruises on abdominal wall after hysterectomy at all. This indicates that the hemostasis (control of bleeding) was not proper, or it occurred as a result of reactionary hemorrhage, meaning blood vessels can open up after the blood pressure shoots up during the post-operative period. Clearing up of the bruises was a good indication, but re-appearance of darker bruises indicates that there is bleeding under the skin. Yes, you should be concerned and consult the operating Surgeon immediately to see whether you need a conservative medical approach or surgical exploration for ligating the offending blood vessels.

We guess you are asking about how to know the secondaries of Breast cancer in the body. There are numerous tests done to detect the secondaries based on the most common sites of secondaries of Breast Cancer. The Oncologist is the person who deals with this. An antibody-based test that is used to detect circulating breast cancer cells and provide prognostic information for patients during treatment may not detect all subtypes of breast cancer. The following are the tests to detect the cancer cells like AMOS - Anti-malignin antibody screen tests. Biological Terrain Assessment (BTA) is a computerized device that measures your blood, saliva and urine for: the amount of electrons present, pH balance, and minerals in these fluids.  It will show how healthy your cells are. Cancer Marker Tests: These are immunological methods - cancer markers that are produced as cancer grows and are detectable even before it reaches a size big enough for detection by other methods like alphafetoprotein, CA 15.3, CA 19.9, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

HiT hank you for your question to Chat Doctor. Causes of back pain after spinal surgery are several and may be hardware related or pathology in the back itself.Some common causes are infection, nonunion of the bones one of the strong predisposing factors for which is infection and prominent hardware. Screw heads may become prominent in thin individuals and cause problems. Infection is a major concern if there is increasing pain and MRI scan and blood tests can help with diagnosis. Diagnosis of nonunion requires a CT scan. An X-ray will reveal a broken screw in most of the cases. CT scan images the spine in three dimensions and is confirmatory. For your condition I would recommend a CT scan and MRI of the spine with and without contrast. A prominent or broken screw is uncommon to be the cause of pain by itself. It is the nonunion which is indirectly indicated by a broken screw that is the cause of pain. Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Wish you the best.

Hello, As history appears to show there is a weakness of the muscles of the stomach. For stomach to have a proper function the abdominal muscles need to be strong to support the stomach. Now stomach muscles are soft tissue muscle and abdominal are skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscles are controlled by human desire and soft tissue are by the autonomous nervous system. The exercise which you need to do it - straight crunches for the upper abdomen. Later crunches for the side muscles of the abdomen. The procedure is simple. Lye down on the mat with crook lying position. Then lift the head and shoulder 2-4 inches off the floor and try going towards the knee. And the other one you should do later bend. This is one of the simplest forms to give support to the stomach muscles providing good strength. You can the videos online as well. Hope I have answered your query.

Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. You should not worry, I will explain you something and give you my opinion. This seems to be a heart rhythm issues. There are some electrical impulses that generate in a part of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm. This cause a premature heart contraction, that's not a normal one. You feel this like a palpitation, like a skipped beat that makes you cough or have difficulties in breathing deeply. There might be different causes of this rhythm issues like stress, coffee consumption, alcohol, so you have to avoid this. Pathology like anemia, hyperthyroidism, electrolytic disturbances or cardiac anomalies might be other causes. So, electrolyte disturbances, thyroid or parathyroid gland problems might explain even your hands problems, numb or tingly sensation, so you have to check them. If I was your treating doctor I will ask for some examination like a full blood check up, your thyroid problems, a cardiac echo, and a holder rhythm monitoring. Through this we can better know what we are dealing with and how to treat them. As you say, you have a very stress period and this might be the cause. It will soon pass. Hope I was helpful. Best regards.

Hello, Thanks for the question. Upper back region is a very common site of a benign lipomatous tumor called Lipoma. It usually occurs around the middle age and presents with radiological features similar to your case and CURABLE by surgery alone. However, it can only be confirmed by a biopsy(needle or open) or cytology. In my opinion as a Pathologist, A Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)OR an Incisional Biopsy both can confirm the true nature of your husbands lump. It is mandatory and essential for categorization and treatment. Though you did not mention the duration of the lump your husband is suffering from, and I suspect it is a long time(months). If that is the case, it emphases the presence of a benign lesion like lipoma. In conclusion, I would like to mention that, FNAC is a much faster and day care procedure which can alleviate your mental tension quickly. The only downside is you have to go for a biopsy ultimately if it fails or not done and reported by a person who is experienced and familiar with the procedure. Hope this helps. Feel free to contact again for any other question.

Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Many of the spider bites usually do not cause much harm except for some spiders like black widow spider and brown recluse spider. Your symptoms are suggestive of a brown recluse spider bite where the skin around the bite wound swells and reddens due to a local reaction. Such wounds should be cleaned thoroughly to avoid secondary bacterial infection. Based on the symptoms you have mentioned in your query, I suspect the above scenario where your wound was not attended to in time and secondary bacterial infection has occurred leading to cellulitis. Cellulitis is caused by bacteria like staphylococcus and streptococcus. You were correctly treated by broad spectrum antibiotics as cellulitis spreads very fast and cause septicemia. Hope I have helped you with this answer. Thanks.

Hello, Well, I don't think there is something called as an underdeveloped shoulder as terminology in medicine if it does exist I really don't know. First time listening something like this. Also, maybe the attending physician has meant, that there is a weakness of the muscles of one shoulder when compared to another, apart from that I do not understand what is an underdeveloped shoulder. Not when you mention the pain in the neck and shoulder, I think this should be related to the cervical radiculopathy. If you can take an MRI of the cervical spine we can understand some things better. Because the pain in the neck and shoulder can be due to two reasons, one it might be inflammation of the trapezius muscle or might be the nerve entrapment. I will advise you to take a neck collar and use it for a week or two, during this use hot water fermentation for the neck, upper back and shoulder - front and back region. See if you find any changes if any muscle inflammation is present than you might get relief of it, and later you can do some slow strengthening exercises under a guided physiotherapist for both the neck and the shoulder muscles. Coming to the deformity of the thumb and index finger, if you put more details in front of me that I can understand and comment over it as, as of now it is little difficult with the so small statement about the thumb and index finger deformity. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

Hi, Thanks for the query. It is possible to get pregnant even before you get a normal cycle after stopping birth control pills. You have not even missed your period yet, so it is very early to say if pregnancy has occurred. The breast discomfort, nausea and tenderness are non-specific. They may be due to pregnancy or even premenstrual syn Chat Doctor.  The earliest that pregnancy can be detected is by a blood test after about 28-30 days or just around the missed period and by a urine test 7-10 days after the missed period. Please do not be so anxious. You have been through all this. Just relax. I suggest that you start tablet folic acid as it helps in the babies brain development. Hope I was able to help you. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. I would be happy to answer any further queries. Have a nice day and take care.

Hi and thank you for using Chat Doctor. Cysts in the kidneys are commonly found in people as we age.  The finding of a few simple cysts on an ultrasound in and of itself would not warrant further evaluation. The findings of a cyst that would warrant further evaluation would be large size (right around where his are or greater), complexity of the cyst by imaging which would indicate that it is not just fluid-filled or any masslike characteristics. If the original imaging was done in May 2011 and there has been no change in the size, it would seem unlikely to be of any significance. To reassure yourself, I would suggest that you request an MRI to further characterize the cyst as well as urine cytology. Benign findings on an MRI and negative urine cytology would be highly reassuring without the need for further extensive workup.
Hi, You took Closed form 3rd to 7th day. Size of follicle is 10 mm only. That follicle will normally grow to 18-24 mm at time of ovulation. So your follicle size does not indicate ovulation.

You can ask doctor for Tablet Metformin to induce ovulation Chat Doctor shot, Progesterone and Ova care pill. If medicine will no response then go for ovarian Chat Doctor. Avoid stress, take healthy diet,
Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with stage 3b is inoperable and hence incurable. Only treatment option is palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lung surgery is contraindicated and carries life-threatening risk. Since, you had taken plenty of radiation and chemotherapy, better to start palliative treatment in the form of nutrition and pain management. Better to discuss end of life issues with your family. Start centrally acting painkiller for pain relief. There is nothing much to be done in your case, so accept the situation.
Urinary tract infection could be a possible cause of low back pain. Please complete the full course of antibiotics and see if she gets relief.

HiT hank you for your question to Chat Doctor. Leg pain and weakness can stem from pressure or intrinsic pathology of the nerve.

Rarely thoracic disc herniation (midback) can lead to such symptoms and MRI of the thoracic spine would be the next step if no correlating picture is found in lumbar spine. Hope this is helpful. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

HelloThanks for posting here. The symptoms you have mentioned can be caused by pleurisy. Pleurisy is an infection of the outer covering of the lungs called the pleura. It can cause pain along the ribs increasing on deep breathing, fever, breathing difficulty and cough. It takes about two weeks to be cured hence you may feel weak and dizzy. Another reason here may be due to antibiotics. Some people do not tolerate antibiotics and have dizziness after antibiotic use. So keep taking the medications you have been prescribed and if you don't feel fine after three more days (total 5 days on antibiotics, you must visit your doctor and get your antibiotics changed. At this point of time just two days after pleurisy, you need not be worried. Just give your body and antibiotics time to fight. Wishing you good healthRegards

Hi, There is no medication which can cure or prevent Chicken pox. Tampico is an antibiotic, something that affects bacteria & Chicken pox is a virus !! How can it help. It only reduces secondary infections after you get chicken pox. If your partner has chickenpox, better you delay attempting for pregnancy till fully healthy. When male gets infections-their sperm count, motility & health is reduced. So pregnancy chances are low. In women - Ovulation may not occur due to fever. But incidentally if you get pregnant, the virus in chicken pox & fever itself will cause certain irreparable damages in the baby. Either it will end in abortion or baby with certain defects warranting abortion. So I would advise you to wait for the infection to completely leave your house for you to try for pregnancy. Hope I have cleared your overall the best Chat Doctor.
Hi, Unfortunately, there is no specific medication treatment, non-pharmacological, and no surgical approach to congenital cerebellar degeneration.  FBI q is an antioxidant whose biochemical properties allow it to support energy production chemical reactions within cells.  However, this is not in and of itself a way of stopping or reversing the chronic neurodegenerative process.  We do not understand how or why this process begins in the first place.  It is not an unreasonable pharmacy agent to use, but there is nothing any more specific either, so I think you can continue using it. The major side effects of this medication are the following:Gastric discomfort loss of appetitediarrheanauseaskin rash, and heart burn If are not suffering from any of these side effects...or even if you are and the symptoms are mild or tolerable perhaps, it would be reasonable to ask your doctor whether you can INCREASE the dose. To see if more effect can be realized.  Another form of treatment for this disorder would be to engage in VESTIBULAR REHABILITATION which can ad Chat Doctor.  I hope this answers your query. I remain at your disposal in case further medical assistance is needed. Wish you the best of health. Thank you.
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. It is unfortunate that you were not informed about sexual abstinence for at least 3-6 weeks after a cesarean section. But, nothing can be done about that now. Do not worry. The only reason why sexual intercourse is restricted for this duration, is because we need to give the body time to heal, and sexual intercourse delays that. So nothing serious to worry about, from the last date of sexual, I would request you to abstain from sexual intercourse for at least 3-4 weeks. I am sure everything will be fine by then. If you experience any other symptoms in between, feel free to write back to me or visit your doctor. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: http://doctor.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.  I would gladly help you. Best wishes.

Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. In every case of this is available, it should be always accepted to have home dialysis since this is more practical and may spare you lot of time and be less psychologically traumatic. The obvious advantage of peritoneal dialysis is that regular visits to a dialysis unit aren't required, and it can be carried out at home without needing any bulky hemodialysis equipment. One of the main disadvantages of peritoneal dialysis is that it needs to be carried out every day, which you may find very disruptive and another major disadvantage of peritoneal dialysis is that you're at risk of developing peritonitis however this is rarely seen and usually signs of this infection will be obvious, so you will consult doctor on time if it happens. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.

Hi, I'm sorry to hear you've been diagnosed with a bone infection. I can understand your question as the treatment for a bone infection takes a long time, often for at least six weeks. If the MRI showed signs of infection and other markers like C-reactive protein were high, you could presume there was a bone infection.  If they did a blood culture that grew a bacterium, or did a bone biopsy that showed infection, that would support the diagnosis, but is not absolutely necessary. Even though all your blood work looks good now, and you don't have any symptoms, I would encourage you to finish the treatment your doctor has started until complete, since it takes a long time to clear an infection in the bone, and it may seem like you're healed but if you stop antibiotics early the infection may come back. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Hello, your cholesterol measurements are very different (about 30%). Have you been taking any cholesterol lowering Chat Doctor?

Warm water gargles 5-6 times a day. Take antihistamine and anti-inflammatory
Hi I think your sister-in-law has undergone a laparoscopy operation. The cleaning of tubes means if any block was there in the tubes' cannulation was done.

It is simpler than a laparoscopy and will tell you regarding your tubes. You can try GUI after HSG if your tubes are OK. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any other query I will be happy to help.

Occasionally, it can spread from a mother to her baby during pregnancy. It does not spread via common items like toilet seats.  It is not found in saliva so is not transmitted by licking.

I have had a patient this past week with this same problem. It is addictive and very difficult to treat. I told this patient what I will tell you. It is important to remove triggers from your environment, things that make you want to masturbate, that remind you of masturbating. Television, videos, internet, magazines... these can all be sources for temptation that make it hard for you to resist. I would start by changing your environment. It also helps to keep a journal, writing down your thoughts, feelings, and reasons for wanting to masturbate, to better understand your motivations and gain insight into your addiction. Having a therapist if one is available, one who can maintain confidentiality, is a plus. I would disagree to rush into a marriage just to get out of your masturbation issues. If intimacy with a partner is your issue, it might be helpful to consider trying to desensitize yourself by ad Chat Doctor.  Do you watch pornography? Do you have any history of sexual abuse? You really need to evaluate why you have this problem and try to understand it. It is also, in many ways, a normal thing to try to experiment, masturbate, especially in your teenage years. There is nothing wrong with this. However, if it becomes to a point where you cannot maintain relationships, difficulty obtaining a job, or affecting your life in other ways, then it is no longer considered normal but rather an addiction. Hope this helps.

Hi.... you are right about the concept that antibiotics should not be used unnecessarily. But the painless vaccines, do not contain antibiotics. This is not the reason why the baby does not develop fever while giving painless vaccine.

So please do not worry about the presence of antibiotics in painless vaccine. Regards -

Hello, I went through your query. The swelling under your neck is maybe either a swollen lymph node or a swollen salivary gland. The lymph nodes below the jaws will get enlarged as a reaction to any local infection like an infected tooth or gums. And the fact that is very painful, it is more indicative of an infection.

There is no "Safe way" to delay period without using a pill or without disrupting the normal cycle. Hope this was helpfulWarm Regards Chat Doctor.

Hi, I had gone through your query and understand your concerns. This is a common problem experienced by women taking birth control pills. Wat you are taking is a combined pill(levonorgesterl and ethinylestradiol) which contain both estrogen and progesterone. It will take 90 days(3 months) to restore your normal ovulation and periods, once you stop the pills. So hopefully you will have ovulation by mid-March and bleeding by last weeks of march. And be warned that this can vary from person to person. So don't do unprotected Sexual intercourse, as you can still become pregnant these days, if sperm reach your uterus. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.

Hi Mather, I can understand your concern. Psoriasis can be brought into remission but cannot be completely cured. However, don't lose heart and do not change your doctor frequently as it affects the treatment. The treatment of psoriasis basically depends upon the extent of involvement and response of the lesions to treatment. The treatment of psoriasis usually fails when patients compliance with the medicine is poor. Multiple treatment options are available in the form of topical (emollients, steroids, tacrolimus, Nazarene, calcitriol etc.), oral therapies(methotrexate, accretion, cyclosporine etc.), photo based therapies and biological. Now what is going to suit you can only be understood when one has elicited a proper clinical history and has examined your skin and scalp involvement. Secondly, it is also important to know what medicines you have used till date and for how long to decide upon a proper treatment therapy. Kindly consult a dermatologist for same. Take care.

Thank you for posting your question.birthmarks in child Chat Doctor.  The mark under the elbow that you mentioned might have evolved to become thicker and hence palpable.However, it is important to know what kind of birthmark (hyperpigmented/pigmented/hairy etc.) that you are talking about, which could help us rule out any other cause. By and large it seems to be a benign occurrence and the only thing that needs to be done is keeping a watch for similar lumps on other parts of body or an increase in size of the existing lump. If so, a medical consultation would be advisable. Also rule out some trivial local injury that may have caused a temporary swelling under the elbow. If you need any more advice regarding this, do write back.

Hello, Numb areas can include the cheek, lip and tongue with dental anesthesia. A risk can include biting these areas before the anesthetic wears off. This trauma will cause swelling. In general, you do not have to worry. Initial placement of ice is helpful to limit swelling. Tylenol, at the appropriate dose, can reduce inflammation. Warm salt water rinses and endocrine gels can help provide some relief. Help your daughter avoid the area and maintain a soft diet. Normal sensation should have returned to her mouth. Inform your dentist of this condition. Consider completing less dental treatment in a visit, so there is less numbness afterwards. A follow-up visit will be needed if condition seems to be getting worse rather than slowly improving. Time to heal will usually be all that is needed. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope that your daughter feels better soon.

I read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. The decision to undergo surgery though is not taken solely on your imaging results but also on what symptoms do they cause and their intensity. Also, usually conservative treatment and physiotherapy is always tried for some months first. If you have intense pain which hasn't responded to physical therapy then I believe surgery for the changes in L4-L5 with severe canal and lateral recess narrowing. At time if the symptoms do not correspond to compression at this level nerve conduction studies are done beforehand to make sure which level needs to be ad Chat Doctor. I hope to have been of help.

Hi, How are you doing ? POD (Polycystic ovaries), This is a congenital condition, I mean it is a genetically programmed condition, you get it from your parents. When you suddenly put on weight, this cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone (if I may simulate- haven't you have seen obese men developing breast & in young obese girls, who develop periods at younger age - they all have high levels of Estrogen hormone / female hormone) In your body too when fat, which is a store for tomorrow, is more than normal, this is converted to hormone which tips the balance between FSH (from brain) & the ovarian hormone. FSH(Follicle Stimulating Hormone) as name suggests stimulates follicle from ovary, but once the follicle is big enough to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the same estrogen hormone from ovary. But when the same estrogen hormone is coming from fat, brain is confused & follicle growth stops early at a smaller follicle size & will not rupture, next scan you will see all these follicles as POLY CYSTIC OVARIES.!!! This is usually associated with Obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for few months & later heavy periods with clots & fleshy masses, or spotting on & off, Thyroid abnormality & prolactin problem indirectly. You develop that extra-pad of fat around the midsegment of body, especially waist, thighs & breast, no fat beyond elbow & knees. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall, dark shade over lower half of face, acne, oily face skin, black skin over back of neck, inner thighs & under surface of breast. May have a family history of Diabetes, especially father or his family. This will not allow ovulation to occur at time & so you cannot get pregnant, till treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution. Your weight has to be Weight(in Kg)= Height (in CMS)-100Your expected weight is 53-58 kg. Once you reduce weight to normal range, you won't need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant & pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight -NO FASTING, No junk food/ fast foods/ red meat, reduce snacks in between mealsHave low calories' food, high proteinsRegular exercise (especially for the waist & hip area), aerobics, yoga, brisk walking(swing your hands well) ,try to reduce 2-4 kg / month. Don't hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 5 kg, you will see changes. When you take Primolut-N only your periods get altered, does not do any good or bad to your pregnancy chances Hope I have clarified your queries. Do write back if anymore queries the best

Hi ! From your history, it is possible that you had a chance conception with a miscarriage which is partial. That is why there was dark bleeding followed by a pink discharge.

The headaches and frequent urination might be due a co-existing Urinary Tract and pelvic Infection following the miscarriage. I suggest you not to delay visiting your gynecologist. Wishing you an early recovery.
Cellophane you for contacting Chat Doctor. Sneezing mostly occurs because of allergic response. As you have chronic allergy problem, so there must be some allergic element which triggers sneezing.

Blood spit occurs because of severe sneezing response. It damages the mucosal lining which in return results in blood spitting.

Hi, I can understand the distress you must be in due to your symptoms. OCD is a highly distressing condition but is amenable to treatment. You should talk to your parents regarding seeking a psychiatric consultation for yourself. Treatment with medications like fluoxetine will be helpful.

It will consist of sessions which will help in reducing the obsession and the compulsions. I do hope that I was able to answer your query. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.

Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor ! Lower back pain can arise due to a lot of causes, and we need to find out the cause before instituting appropriate treatment. Disdain helps any pain but shouldn't be taken for long when the pain hasn't been diagnosed. Common causes can be disc degeneration due to aging, spondylolisthesis, sacroiliacs, muscle spasm, vertebral disorders, etc. So you are advised to see a physician to ascertain the exact cause through a thorough physical examination and appropriate investigations. Get well soon! Take care.
Hi I am Chat Doctor. .  In my opinion i don't want you to worry on your husband this is usually due to the inflammation of his past shower injury that may have caused compression on his sciatic nerve roots causing such neuropathic pain.  For now I suggest painkiller like Advil tabs when needed, icing it for the 1st 48 hours, massaging it with topical gels, muscle relaxants will be effective for him. Otherwise, I suggest X-rays and MRI any minor fissures or bone injury for proper evaluation and management. Please click THANK YOU and consider a 5-star rating with some positive feedback if the information was helpful. Hope the above information helps you, Any further clarifications feel free to ask.
Hi, your count is normal as it is more than 20 million per ml. The motility is slightly low though normal range is more than 32% as per WHO guidelines of 2010 which used to be earlier set at more than 50%. So the motility is slightly less. That could lead to the failure. There is a possibility of infection in the area which is one of the commonest causes of decreased motility. I suggest you get a Semen culture done and if it is positive you take a course of antibiotics. If it is negative then you might require some other form of treatment for the low motility. Take care, Chat Doctor.
Hi Ashley, A high white blood cell count does not necessarily suggest it is cancer. It can be high is mild infections and inflammations. Jumping into the diagnosis of cancer straight away is not a good approach. First, rule out local infectious causes. Even normally, sometimes the WBC count is high. Cancer in the scrotum usually presents with a painless swelling or nodule of one testicle. In addition, sometimes it presents as dull ache or heavy sensation in the lower abdomen. Without actually confirming the cancer by histopathological examination, nothing can be said for sure. In my personal opinion, I do not think there is any cancer at all. Hope this helps.
Hi.... by what you Quote I feel that it could be eczema of the skin, or it could be an allergic reaction to particular clothing or bed linen which is being used for the baby at night. It could also be a form of contact dermatitis. But as you quote that it has started to scar the area I feel that it could be an eczema which is there for a long time. I suggest a pediatric Dermatologist for this meanwhile you can use hiatus lotion rather than using steroid cream like HY Chat Doctor. Regards -
Hi, Thanks for writing in. The MRI scan brain is as explained below. Brain shows changes due to aging and this has been written are prominent ventricles and cisterns and also reduce brain volume. This is not a serious condition and is an expected finding in the elderly. Confluent periventricular T2 and FLAIR increased signal intensities is due to partial effects of decreased blood flow through the small arteries in the brain. This is nothing serious and can be seen in many people. This happens earlier in those having diabetes and hypertension. The acute brain allergic reaction is not responsible for all your finding in the brain. There is no requirement to seek additional facilities to deal with mental decline if you have made a near complete recovery from the confused and demented state you have had previously. Since you are 85 years old, a little amount of brain volume loss and ischemic small vessel changes are in line and not a big concern if thinking of moving to a community facility for elderly.

Hi, This feeling of tingling and numbness along both thighs is due to pressure on a nerve near the pelvic bone close to the lower abdomen. This nerve runs down the front of the thigh. One gets a feeling of tingling and numbness on and off. This is known to start off in pregnancy when there is stretch of the abdomen wall and also of the pelvic ligaments which in turn stretches this nerve. You need to avoid wearing tight clothes, underclothes which can press upon the lower waist. If its disturbing then your doctor can prescribe certain medication effective for nerve pains. A local steroid injection is sometimes used if the condition is too troublesome. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I hope that answers your question. If you have any further questions please feel free to write. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.

Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. A HIDE scan is an imaging procedure that helps track the production and flow of bile from your liver to your small intestine. You must have been advised this to see if there is any obstruction to the bile flow due to the polyps.

So, please discuss this in detail with your doctor and make an informed decision. Best wishes,
Hi, Thanks for writing in. If your pain is from only inserting your penis, you may want to try using a lubricant, which will make your intimacy more comfortable and pleasurable for the both of you. A lack of lubrication can pull the skin of the penis in uncomfortable ways during sexual activity during inserting and cause pain. Also indulge in good amount of foreplay to allow adequate arousal and emotional connectivity with your partner. The fact that the pain occurs during a second attempt at having sex might be due to decreased lubrication and more friction between penis and vagina.
Hello, By what you say I feel that this could be a simple viral illness. Fever of a few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness.  Usually, rather than fever, what is more, important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.  If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.  Once the viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

Hello, The discoloration is due to bleeding and should resolve on its own, but you can use some warm compresses to help speed up the process. They sometimes touch a nerve when they insert the needle and this can be responsible for the shock like feeling. That too will resolve but can take a few weeks, there is nothing you can do to speed up that process. Sorry this happened. Use some warm compresses and take ibuprofen if you are very uncomfortable. Regards
Hi thanks for your question. Your daughter is having kidney stone and biggest one removed through ureteroscope. The increase in pain after procedure could be due to small pieces of stones which broke from main big stone while removing or big stone is crushed to make it into small pieces so that it can be easily removed. These small left over pieces of stone try to pass out with urine and cause sever colicky pain. Colicky pain is always very sever, and it is due to obstruction of hollow viscus. She might be getting sever colicky pain when these small pieces of stone pass through with urine. The treatment she is receiving is right. She has to be on higher doses of strong painkiller like morphine or ketamine. Once all leftover pieces of stone pass away with urine she will have relief from pain. Advise her to take plenty of water.Re-consultation with urologist is advisable. Hope this answers your question.
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Instead of dwelling more into psychiatric medicinal cure, please look into alternative methods.

Psychotherapy can help you to change your lifestyle and thinking patterns. Yoga and meditation help you to streamline your metabolism and neurological balance. Please consult a psychologist for further information. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of Intertwine, which is inflammation of the body folds. There is superimposed candida infection in most cases (Candida Intertwine). Clinically intertwine presents as red, moist, scaly patches of skin on closely opposed body folds. Closely opposing body folds e.g. finger webs, thighs/groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area prone to Intertwine. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole/ketoconazole/fluconazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. An OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine spy, once daily would help in symptomatic itch relief. An Antifungal dusting powder e.g. clotrimazole dusting powder, would not only keep the area Chat Doctor.

In that case, I am going to prescribe you with Gabapentin or Pregabalin to treat your neuropathic pain. You also need to regulate your blood sugar by taking Insulin Glargine or Insulin Aspart, Human, along with Glipizide or Glyburide. Additionally, you can take Sitagliptin to improve blood sugar control or Rosiglitazone to increase insulin sensitivity. If you have any cuts or sores on your feet, I recommend applying Silver Sulfadiazine topical to prevent infection. In case of any non-healing wounds, Allcyte Collagenase topical may be applied. Lastly, consume more fiber in your diet or take Cellulose supplements to regulate your bowel movements.

My advice is to wait and watch and visit her doctor if vomiting persist. Do not worry if she doesn't take a meal or so.

You can offer her banana, lemon water, buttermilk etc. You are the parent, and you are supposed to enforce these things.
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The painand swelling could be because of the tooth infection. Sensitivity is the initial symptom of decay.

Cough and tooth infection are two different conditions. You can take a course of antibiotics and analgesics like amoxicillin 500Â mg and metronidazole 400Â mg TID for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Do saline gargling. I hope my answer will help you, take care.
Happen 250Â mg Tablet is a Penicillin group antibiotic containing Penicillin V/ Phenoxymethyl penicillin (250Â mg). Brands containing this penicillin is very less. It is not much prescribed nowadays.

The presence of reduced kidney and heart function would significantly affect his ability to respond appropriately to treatment, but it is possible that he may recover.

I hope this helps
Hi. Noted gallbladder stone on ultrasound result. If your symptom is recurring, persistent, progressing - it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, so you can discuss with him the plan of management for your case (conservative or clinical monitoring of your gallstone vs surgical intervention). Definitive treatment is cholecystectomy (removal of your gallbladder along with the stone), which can be done laparoscopically (gold standard) or through open technique. It is not an emergent case, but there must be a sense of urgency in managing your case especially if you're already experiencing symptoms. Low fat diet is also recommended as intake of fatty meal triggers/aggravates biliary colic. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.

Hello thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for your health related queriesSudden episodes of fainting, rolling of fist or tightness, wide open eyes etc. symptoms can occur due to some neurological possibilities. Syncope, some seizure discharge or even sleep paralysis can cause similar symptoms. As this sudden loss of consciousness was associated with fainting and tightness of extremities, so it points more towards some seizure disorder. You should take her to a neuropsychiatric for proper help. She should undergo EEG testing to rule out any seizure focus and CT imaging to rule out any brain lesion if any. Once every thing comes normal then she can be evaluated with detail by a neuropsychiatric. Thanks, hope this helps you. Take care

Hi, Thanks for writing in. You might be having chronic pyelonephritis. Since this has been happening for the last one year therefore there is scarring in the kidneys' collection.  This scarring can cause a prominent collecting system which can be the reason for appearance on CT. Usually this can happen even after the infection is treated. Since you have an abdominal pain and fever, therefore it is essential to get urine culture is important. Sometimes, with fever a blood culture can also be helpful in the diagnosis of an infection causing organism in blood. Doing antibiotic sensitivity at the same time will give an indication on which antibiotics are to be taken for treatment.
Hi, How are you? I am so sorry to hear about your fathers condition. One thing not clear form your question is whether the stone in the bile duct was removed. Stenting is normally done after ERCP and stone removal to give the bile duct a chance to heal. Once adequate time has elapsed, the stent no longer serves any purpose and hence is removed. The reason it has to be removed or exchanged with a new one at regular intervals is due to the fact that long-standing stents are prone to blockage and infection both of which can have potentially serious consequences. But given your dads condition, and if he does not have any symptoms like pain, fever, jaundice, etc. it is my opinion that you could wait on the stent removal with a very, very low threshold to get it removed if any symptoms arise. Hope this helps, and please do not hesitate to contact me for further clarifications.

Hi I am Chat Doctor. .  Actually amitriptyline HCl is a type of antidepressant used for balancing chemicals in your brain. Sometimes used as a painkiller or a sedating agent to help you sleep with patients having severe chronic pain.  You could not use it without your doctor prescription especially with Prozac as both antidepressants may cause severe side effects sometimes very dangerous or even fatal with increased doses.  In my opinion if you have a kind of neuropathic pain pregabalin or gabapentin will be more reliable but you have to ask your trading doctor for best dosing if you are using any other medications for other health issues.  You may avoid heavy lifting, over weighing, vigorous movements, bad sleeping or sitting postures and high cholesterol or high protein and salty components, and you will feel better soon.  For my patients I recommend painkillers like Advil tab when needed, hot gentle massaging with topical gels of anti-inflammatory, B12 vitamin supplements, muscle relaxants will be effective for most of the cases. Steroid tabs or injection may be needed in more sever cases.  B12 supplements and pregabalin have best results with nerve pains, if pain persist I recommend some lab investigations like urinalysis, ASCOT, Rheumatoid factor and X-rays, MRI and follow them up with your physician for proper evaluation and management of the underlying causes of such nerve pain. Please click and consider a 5-star rating with some positive feedback if the information was helpful. Wish you good health, Any further clarifications feel free to ask.
Dear patient Epidural injection is gone given in epidural space and contains steroid escort which reduces inflammation and swelling around nerves. Since you have got disc prolapse at two levels and not relieves with medication and physiotherapy it might be helpful. But what are the canal diameter at disc levels that is not mentioned.  If spinal canal diameter is less than 8 mm at disc prolapse levels then epidural steroid injection will not work and surgery is required to remove disc. Also, epidural injection benefits more in leg pain relief than back pain relief. So you can go for spinal Injection and hope for the best and no one can guarantee permanent relief. They are very safe and given under local anesthesia without any significant side effects.

Your lower back pain could be related to the compression fractures or from local inflammation that developed late. There are a few options for managing this pain1. I would recommend a repeat X-ray of the spine to exclude any changes in the bones since the original fall (since the last X-ray was one month back its possible things have changed since then)2. Physical therapy is often very helpful and can be tried3. In terms of medications, you could try Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not take more than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen over a 24-hour period. You can also try Ibuprofen (400-800 mg three times a day with food)- it has an anti-inflammatory effect. Do not take Ibuprofen if you have a history of chronic kidney disease, bleeding from your gut or severe reflux. Since the X-ray will need to be ordered and interpreted by a physician, I recommend you see your primary care doctor too.

Hallow Dear, Bleeding with recurring episodes at 10 weeks duration of pregnancy is not a good sign and needs investigations. Hormone levels may not be good indicators to help to diagnose babies jeopardy since it takes about 8-10 days for the hormone levels to Chat Doctor.  Your Chat Doctor levels were 22 mid. During pregnancy, they have to be more than 25 mid. Any levels between 5 mid and 25 mid suggest that the baby may have been jeopardized or the baby may be present outside the uterine cavity (ectopic pregnancy). I would suggest you to get ultrasonography done which will inform us:1. Whether the baby is viable2. Whether the baby is in the uterine cavity or not. If the viable baby is in the uterine cavity, you may start some Progestational medicine with the advice of your Obstetrician; and restrict yourself to the bed till you have full one week without ant vaginal bleeding. After one week, again repeat the ultrasonography scan and then your doctor can decide about the further line of action. I hope this helps you.

Your symptoms may be premenstrual as well and are not specific for an early pregnancy. Wish you success.

Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that you are quite distressed about the feelings for a girl you had come across recently. Though it is fairly normal for persons to have emotional attachments / feelings towards someone they like, this becomes a problem if it starts affecting your life and daily routine. Moreover, it is not rational to keep thinking about her and having feelings for her when you know that she is already married to someone else. So, I would suggest that you go for counselling in order to help you overcome these thoughts and feelings. Wish you all the best.
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thank you for your query. It may be lymphoma, but it has to be confirmed by biopsy. You didn't mention what exactly this previous biopsy showed.

Lymphomas can be also ruled out by certain blood tests and sternal function. Wish you good health. Regards.
Hallow Dear, You have to consider multiple things while trying for pregnancy. 1. Even though your one tube is removed, remaining one tube is very much capable of picking up the eggs discharged from both the ovaries for conception, provided that tube is patent. I would advise you to undergo hysterosalpingography (X-ray of the uterus and tube after filling in radio-opaque dye) and/or Laparoscopy to assess then patency of the tube, normalcy of the uterine cavity (HSG) and any adhesions in the pelvis (Laparoscopy). 2. You are having irregular menstruation. Though one test by ovulation monitoring kit has indicated ovulation, maybe you are not ovulating regularly every month. You may undergo regular ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography. This will guide you for the day of intercourse also. Furthermore it can find out the thickening of the uterine lining and size of the follicle when egg was released. Follicles between 18-21 mm size give best results. 3. Please get your husbands' semen also examined for its quality.4. If you have missed your period for one month, it is a good idea to get pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample. I hope this should help you.

Hi, Yes, she had her last period on 14 January and you were on leave from Feb 3 to 9,which is Around the time of ovulation, and it is very, very likely that it is your baby, unless you have some other suspicion.

Hello, Since your injury is 10 yrs old, so it is very unlikely to still have a broken rib, floating ribs are the last two ribs which doesn't have sternal attachments, thats normal anatomy and not a pathology.

Hello and welcome, You seem to have a torch test showing high titles of rubella and CMV. They are both viruses and are responsible for causing abortions and birth defects if the mother is infected with them during pregnancy. These infections are common and only active infections during pregnancy harm the baby. You are having high titles of the Egg antibody. This antibody comes after recovering from the infection and indicates that there was an infection in the past. The normal levels are less than 1. However, your rubella and CMV Egg is a bit on the higher side even now. So please get it tested after a month or so and see if levels are decreasing. If they are decreasing you may attempt pregnancy.

Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! I passed carefully through your question and would explain that Lyme disease can mimic all this clinical scenario. A thyroid dysfunction can not be excluded either. Coming to this point, I would recommend repeat the blood lab tests for Lyme disease and perform a Western Blot test too. From the other hand, it is necessary also performing further tests to investigate for other possible causes: - a chest X-ray study-complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation- a cardiac ultrasound- an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring in order to examine your heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia- thyroid hormone levels for possible dysfunction. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Kind regards,
Dear Patient, sure, this is called uremic breath. This is due by the elimination of some volatile molecules containing above with the breath. This happens when serum academia starts to be high.

I suggest discussing this problem with your nephrologist. Maybe your kidney function is getting worse. Take care.

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having stress and anxiety related palpitations. But better to rule out arrhythmia (disturbances in heart rhythm) because this can actually also cause similar symptoms. So get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Stress and anxiety appear more likely in your case. So avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hi, How are you? Where are you writing from? The above set of labs suggests there is blockage of the bile duct (the pipe which empties bile juice from liver into the intestine) at some level. There are multiple reasons for this and can include something as simple as a stone inside the duct or could be something dangerous like cancer. The cause can be very easily found by doing a scan of the belly (ultrasound, CT, MRI etc.) and some simple blood tests to look for cancer. You could be treated based on that. Also, an endoscopy (ERCP) and stenting of the bile duct will bring down your jaundice levels. Medications usually will not work for this kind of jaundice. Hope this helped and hope you feel better soon. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details or for sharing any scan reports - rxsuresh@gmail.com

Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would not recommend taking statins unless you have dyslipidemia. You should know that our brain is made in great part from cholesterol. So cutting of cholesterol levels, can lead to memory problems.

So, I would not recommend statins for primary prevention, unless there is dyslipidemia (Total cholesterol/HDL ratio above 4.5 and LDL/HDL ratio above 3.5). Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards,

When patients with similar problem come to my clinic, I prescribe them Capsule Fluoxetine with Clonazepam. These medicines must be taken under guidance and medical supervision otherwise it may be harmful. I also suggest behavior therapy like relaxation and cognitive therapy.

Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. This sounds like biliary colic, but also there can be associated pancreatitis or hepatic distension pain. I don't consider this is an emergency, but you should consider cholecystectomy as soon as possible. These stones can cause intensive pain, cholecystitis or pancreatitis so be aware of it. If you notice dark urine, jaundice, pain in the back fever and vomiting you should go to ER. Wish you good health.
Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. On ultrasound pancreas cannot be visualized on occasions as it is always behind the stomach, duodenum. So proper visualization is difficult and CT may be necessary for evaluating it.2. Elevated LDL levels can be reduced either by medication or lifestyle changes or both.3. Lifestyle modifications include weight reduction, moderate exercises and having diet containing moderate amounts of good fat. Avoid alcohol and smoking.4. Fatty infiltration of liver is due to increased lipid profile. It is reversible and will recover with improved lipid profile. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.
Hi, thank you for the brief history of you. As you said you had a fall and also some knots over your scalp. You should see if you have any redness of the eye, bleeding from the nose or ear etc. Also, as you have a direct impact on the scalp I will advise to meet a physician on a safer note for him to examine you. Also you can take an MRI to see if any internal bleeding is there at a later stage if you have any abnormal symptoms. Swelling is a normal physiological process, and it subsided in 48-72 hours or may be a little longer depending upon the age and other factors. As you said apart from this you don't have any symptom than you can wait for a while do some icing and things should be fine. If you find any abnormal symptoms you can visit the ER on a safer side. With the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery
Hello Thanks for writing to according to report, you are suffering from degenerative disc disease of cervical spine. Degenerative changes occur in spine due to aging and development of weakness in annulus fibrosis.1. At C2-3 level, there is disc-osteophyte complex which is indenting the thecal sac.2. At C3-4 level, osteophyte complex is encroaching the right lateral neural foramen.3. At C5-6 level there is concentric disc bulge which is effacing ventral thecal sac and encroaching right lateral neural canal which is causing moderate right former stenosis. Majority of the cases of degenerative spine disease are benefited by physiotherapy, so physiotherapy should be tried first. Surgery should be the last option. There are also medicines like capsule pregabalin available for pain relief. Treatment can be planned after consultation with neurosurgeon. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor.
Hi, greetings from Chat Doctor. From your description you may be suffering from folliculitis with abscess formation. Insect bite is another possibility which can produce a raised red-hot swelling.

Hello. Welcome to Chat Doctor. Chest pain, breathlessness and fast heart rate while walking or during any exertion can be due to angina. When you walk or exert, the hearts' oxygen demand increases and hence the blood flow to the heart also increases. If the arteries are having blockages, then this supply is hampered leading to chest pain, breathlessness. The heart tries to compensate by beating faster hence the fast heart rate. Breathlessness in your case can also be continued by asthma. I recommend you do an ECG and a 2 d echo for cardiac evaluation. If both ECG and 2d echo are normal then you must undergo a stress test. It tests the functional capacity of the heart and can predict presence of blockages in the heart. Also, I hope you are compliant on your asthma medications and inhalers. I suggest you do a PFT (pulmonary function test) also to evaluate the functional capacity of the lungs. All these together will give a definite reason for your symptoms. Wishing you good health Regards.
Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer symptoms of bowel includes sudden change in bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea. Some people also experience bleeding in stools. Unexplained loss of weight can also be seen in bowel cancer. Since you have recent onset diarrhea then you should get a detailed cancer screening examination done. I suggest you get your stools tested for occult blood till the time you have to wait to see your surgeon. If there is occult blood in stools and as you have strong family history therefore you should get a colonoscopy done. It will locate any abnormal areas of polyps which are precursors to colon cancer. Doing colonoscopy and ultrasound scan of abdomen might highlight any suspicious area causing you the strange feeling whether inside the bowel or anything on the outside. Please do not worry.
Hi, thank you for providing a brief history of your mother. Well as you mentioned she is 88 we need to see her as more of an ageing degenerative change in her body.

Now talking to her Alzheimer's disease and pain you need to look for a physical therapist who will use some therapeutic ultrasound therapy and some gradual slow passive movements which will help muscle move and will get ease of the pain.
Hello are having cough for 3 months, got relief after medicine, recurs. Such type of recurring cough with impact on voice may be due to these possibilities, these include:1 Allergic bronchitis, diagnosis can be confirmed by physical examination by a physician. In this type of cough usually patient come in contact with some allergen like, dust, mite, mold, fine dusting powder, hay, fodder, smoke. These allergen produces antigen, antibody reaction and causes bronchoconstriction which produces cough as well as laryngeal irritation produces bad effect on vocal cord (voice).2 Asthmatic allergic bronchitis .3 Laryngeal tuberculosis, diagnosis can be confirmed by laryngoscope examination. In my opinion consult a pulmonologist and get his opinion. Good luck.

To further investigate MRI of the region is advised.  If you are thinking to go to hospital then see an orthopedic I think your query answered. Welcome to any follow-up query.

Hello, Thanks for writing to us. If you had the miscarriage through self-medication, I would ask you to see a specialist for further management.

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more. Bronchitis is inflammation of airways, and it is common after viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) like cold.

So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You will need inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hello and thank you for your question.  Any time you have a red lesion on the side of the tongue that persists longer than a few weeks it is important to have it evaluated in person by a dentist and possibly biopsied.  Oral cancer can occur at any age and is very common on the side of the tongue.  The tried and true method of identification is through biopsy.  Many lesions can appear flat, red and on the side of the tongue.  Highly unlikely that it is cancer at your age, but safe to rule out if it doesn't go away.  Geographical tongue does have a border but not always apparent.  It can also be lichen plans, trauma from an adjacent tooth, chemical burn from medication, new toothpaste, mouth rinse or spicy/citric foods.  I hope this helps you. Best wishes, good health.

Hi, Thanks for writing in. Anxiety after hearing about serious diseases is usual, but you must not think that you have got the disease and will die from it. Most diseases have an underlying cause and a disease like lung or throat cancer will usually occur in people abusing tobacco by smoking or chewing. If you stay away from smoking and chewing tobacco then your chance of cancer in lung or throat is reduced by more than 90 percent. The symptoms of lung cancer are the following cough that does not go away or gets worse. Chest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing. Hoarseness. Weight loss and loss of appetite. Coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum (spit or phlegm)Shortness of breath. Feeling tired or weak. The symptoms of throat cancer are the followingAbnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds. Cough. Coughing up blood. Difficulty swallowing. Hoarseness that does not get better in 1 to 2 weeks. Neck or ear pain. Sore throat that does not get better in 1 to 2 weeks, even with antibiotics. Swelling or lumps in the neck. Having a cancer in lung or throat in you is unusual. Please do not worry.
His not taking breastfeeds could be because he is unwell, or he is unable to latch on to your breast properly. If he is well, check if your nipples are of the right size for him to latch on too correctly. Offer him the full breast and not just the nipple and let him grasp your areola along with the nipple inside his mouth. This will help him to suckle better and avoid the need for Lactose 1. If at all you have to give Lactose 1, give it with a spoon and cup and not with a bottle as this will confuse him, and he will soon stop breastfeeding altogether.

HI. Thanks for an elucidated history. This looks to be tuberculosis unless proved otherwise, One can request for review biopsy just to clear the doubts. Please continue anti-tubercular treatment as the break is not a good idea. And these medicines are good antibiotics in itself.

Please feel free to ask further if you want more clarification Chat Doctor.

Hi, as you had a history of survey in the past for RCI, meeting the same person for the same reason will be advisable. Taking a scan to check which muscles need attention will be easy to plan further. Also certain times there are chances to regain the strength and mobility back without surgery too. I had a patient with RCT with two muscles. She was advised surgery at 67. But we worked out well and she don't need surgery. She can lie 20-30 KGS of weight. No pain and full mobility. You should try a physical therapist who can help you with your complaints. You can discuss the same with the surgeon. With the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of fungal infection. This is because closely opposing body folds e.g. thighs and groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole/ketoconazole/fluconazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. State AF cream contains topical terminating+mometasone. I would rather prefer a plain antifungal like clotrimazole/ketoconazole/fluconazole because mometasone if used for too long can cause side effects like skin atrophy and striaeSince you are already using an Oral antifungal e.g. oral terminating once daily. I would suggest you to continue with it for 4-6 weeks for a more complete urban OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10Â mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief. Keeping the folds Chat Doctor. Regards

Thank you for posting your question. Awareness of ones own heart beats is known as palpitations. There are certain cardiac and non-cardiac causes of this which also includes ingestion of certain things like excessive tea/coffee or certain Chat Doctor. However, it is quite unlikely that an 8 yr old would appreciate his own heart rate, let alone attributing chest pain to his heart. Hence, the way the symptoms are being described by your son, it is likely that he is enacting something that he has seen or heard somewhere. However, not to take his symptoms lightly, I would suggest you keep a watch on his symptoms and look for associated changes like sudden loss of color from his face, vomiting, radiation of pain to any other site, lethargy or irritability, decreased urine output etc. Apart from this acidity or heart burn could also cause symptoms similar to chest pain. In this case decreasing intake of spicy food, having cold milk or ice cream, or

Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A Thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised followed by MRI of the cervical spine. As you have stiff neck, neck pain, numbness of hand and fingers it appears to me a more of the pinched nerve symptoms. An MRI should help understand the level of pinching well. Also, undergoing physical therapy like therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should help reduce the inflammation and pain. Besides exercises on later stages to improve the strength in the muscles for better stability.in my clinical practice such cases are recommended for physical therapy, and they respond well. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.
Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned you have pain from 4 years than it is a chronic backache. For which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is guided. Based on which an MRI of the lumbar spine will be performed. Also, medicine acts as a symptomatic relief to pain and aches. Once medicine is induced in the body, the physical therapist role come into existence. On which by application of the therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy the pain is still taken into control. After that the major role comes is to strengthen the muscles. As muscles are the supporting structures of the spinal bones, the need to strengthen them is of due importance. Once the muscles of the core, pelvic Floor, spinal muscles and hip muscles become stronger the pain is under control. You can perform the exercises at home as it is needed in chronic stages to control the pain in longer run. In my clinical practice I assist patient with three-step therapy.- rest-Medication- physical therapy. Apparanlty we have 100% success rate of controlling the back pain and avoid future recurrence.

Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is primary malignancy arising from the lymph nodes. The lymphoma can spread to surrounding soft tissue. Thus, the lymphoma detected in the soft tissue of the mandible is actually the lymphoma arising in the lymph node involving the adjacent soft tissue. The treatment of the lymphoma involving the lymph node as well as the adjacent soft tissue is similar to lymphoma involving the lymph node alone. Involement of other lymphoid tissues at distant sites should also be sought as this involvement determines the stage of the disease. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.

Hi, thank-you for providing the brief description of your injury A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. As mentioned by you the mechanism of injury I will advise to first get it clinically assessed. As we need to see any muscular or bony injury is present. Also, as you mentioned you were not able to close the jaw, there may be an inflammation of the joint as well as the muscles of the post. May be to come closer to the diagnosis the CT or MRI may be advised to see the bone and the soft tissue status. As head and neck are really an important part of the body, negligence is not advised. Usually due to injury there may be three possibilities - no injury at all, injury to the bone or injury to the muscle & nerves. For coming closer to the issue, a proper assessment is advised. Also, in the front of the neck there is a presence of cartilages which needs an attention. Post that clinical assessment & if needed an MRI or CT the next treatment plan will be initiated based on the symptoms and signs. I wish you a good health and advise avoiding such fights in the future. Life is very important and precious.regards Jay In Chat Doctor.

Hello Thanks for using Chat Doctor .com From the information it looks to me like it is first episode of seizures in her. If some has seizures post infection one has to consider the possibility of Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. MRI of the brain with contrast can diagnose this problem. If MRI is negative other possibilities in her are benign childhood epilepsy probably precipitated by fever. EEG done in sleep can in most instances confirms the diagnosis. If EEG and MRI is normal I personally feel medications are not required at this point of time. Keep her under observation and consider the option of medicines if seizure recurs.

As for whether green tea causes any effect on potassium the answer is there is no study proving this and no report confirming it. Thanks

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Tuberculosis of lung once healed can produce fibrosis and calcification and this appears on chest x-ray for rest of the life. So every time you are not supposed to take anti TB treatment. I advise you to consult pulmonologist and get done1. CT thorax2. Bronchoscopy and BAD (Bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis for tuberculosis. CT thorax gives better idea about lung fibrosis than chest x-ray. Bronchoscopy with BAD is far superior to sputum in determining activity. So if both are negative than you can argue with fitness authority about not having active, infectious disease. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor.First, I would suggest you to complete the course of corticosteroid Chat Doctor.  I would also add montelukast & levocetirizine orally.First, in case of allergic keratoconjunctivitis, there is abnormality in structure of eye. So please don't worry about build up of her eye. Allergy is an abnormal reactivity of immune system. If she has recurrent allergic conjunctivitis, it is important to identify allergen causing her symptoms. For that I would suggest consulting an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise her some allergy testing and identify the cause. Allergic keratoconjunctivitis is usually due to an allergic reaction to air-borne allergens like pollen, molds, etc. So they usually come from environment rather than from peers directly. And therefore, it is not contagious. (If it is contagious, it is not allergy!) Hope you got all the answers for your questions. Wish your granddaughter the best of the health. Regards.

HAI Jemima, Thanks for writing in, From your history it is clear that it is nothing but hematoma (clotted blood). Usually when hematoma resolves, it changes its color from green to black and disappears. Sometimes if there is some hematoma in deeper layers of tissues, then it might take time to resolve. Since X-ray didn't show any fracture, pain has decreased, and you are able to do routine day-to-day activities, there is nothing to worry. But one month is quite long time for a hematoma to resolve. So, it's better to do an ultrasound and confirm whether the blood collection is still there. If it is, there then surgically removing the collection or just aspirating it by wide-bore needle will help in relieving your symptoms. Get well soon, Regards.

Hi Ms Swath, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your fathers medical details. I am glad to note that he has withstood two brain surgeries well. The recent fever may or may not be related to the surgery. Please get him examined by the neurosurgeon to look for any infection at the operation site. If that is ruled out, then, we should look for other sources of infection such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection. I am sure he would improve with physiotherapy and appropriate medical treatment. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/
Hello, The plan B pill does not affect the cervix or the pap smear result, so I do not think you will need to reschedule the examinations another time. On the other hand, the plan B pill may cause your menstruation to be one week earlier or one week later, so you may have your periods when you do not expect them. In this case, if you are bleeding, the doctor may decide not to do the pap-smear because the presence of blood may affect the results of the pap smear. I hope this answers your query. I remain at your disposal for further medical assistance.

A creatinine of 1.5 indicates a kidney function of less than 50%. (because creatine does not rise till 50% function is lost). Most likely it is due to DM and HTN. But it is good to do an ultrasound to check if there is no other problems. Get your urine checked for protein. Some of you heart medications may cause a mild rise in creatinine which is OK. You may need to restrict your salt and fluid (equal to your urine output) else it may put excess load on your heart. Avoid Chat Doctor.  Green vegetables are high in potassium - boil them for 15 mins and discard the water before preparations. Get a nephrologist to assess you in detail.
Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Your symptoms are typically suggestive of a Lumbar disc disease with radiculopathy which implies that a protruded intervertebral disc is compressing over the nerve root causing the pain down the leg. The conservative management of this condition is as follows -* avoid forward bending activities as it will worsen the disc protrusion* avoid lifting heavy weights* Use a lumbosacral back support * Maintain optimum body weight, if you are obese* use of analgesics and muscle relaxants as needed* Intermittent pelvic traction to cause a regression of disc* Physiotherapy to strengthen your back muscles. Physiotherapy has to be done only after the acute pain has subsided. If your symptoms are not resolving with the above measures, then an Epidural steroid injection will help in reducing your pain. Hope this information is helpful. Good day

Hi. Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. You have a very good observation indeed. Generally, menstrual cycles are painful as they are ovulatory cycles. Ovulation is the rupture of ovum and release of egg, necessary for fertilization. The oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and makes the cycles ovulatory.  This is one of the main action of OCP in preventing conception. The pain and bleeding during menstruation are due to increased uterine contraction needed to expel the unfertilized egg products in the form of clots. You have no pain and less bleeding with OCP not only because the cycles are ovulatory but also because the bleeding is with Chat Doctor.  Also, with OCP, your periods will be on a regular cyclical pattern. I hope this is useful to you.

Hi...no anti-allergic is recommended or FDA approved at less than 6 months age. But in medicine it is always risk benefit ratio. So it is the discretion of the clinician to prescribe a medicine or not. My personal opinion is that if the so-called sneezing and chest congestion are not affecting the kidâs daily activities, you need not give him any medicine. Most of the cough and cold in kids are self limiting and seasonal. So do not worry. Regards -

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Ideally we should rule out cardiac cause first for your chest pain.  But you don't have an option for ER visit, ECG can not be possible. I think it is HERD (Castro Esophageal Reflux Disease).  It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Start proton pump inhibitor. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed. 7. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have this habit. 8. Lose weight if you are obese.

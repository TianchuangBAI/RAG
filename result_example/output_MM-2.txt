Avoid touching or irritating the area, keep it clean, and seek medical attention promptly. Your health and peace of mind are important—consider talking to a trusted adult or healthcare professional soon.
Based on your description, you may be experiencing nerve-related symptoms possibly due to a pinched nerve, likely in the lower back or cervical spine, given the leg and trap (trapezius) involvement. The shocks could indicate radiculopathy or nerve irritation. Since symptoms recurred after resuming workouts, consider overuse or improper form contributing to nerve compression. It's important to consult a neurologist or orthopedic specialist for a thorough evaluation, including imaging (MRI) if needed. Avoid heavy lifting until assessed, and consider physical therapy. Do not ignore recurring neurological symptoms; they may signal a more serious underlying issue.
Given your persistent chest pain, difficulty breathing, green/yellow sputum with red spots, and history of asthma, it is concerning and warrants further evaluation. The presence of blood in sputum (hemoptysis) and ongoing symptoms despite treatment suggests the need for urgent reassessment. You should return to A&E or your GP promptly for possible CT scan, sputum culture, and review of antibiotic regimen. Do not delay care; your symptoms may indicate a more severe infection or complication like pneumonia or pleuritis. Rest, hydration, and adherence to prescribed meds are important, but medical follow-up is critical.
It's good that the infection was treated, but persistent bumps under the scars could indicate scar tissue, a cyst, or residual inflammation. Cocoa butter may help with skin hydration but won't resolve underlying issues. It's advisable to have her evaluated by a healthcare provider to rule out complications such as abscess, granuloma, or infection recurrence. A physical exam and possibly imaging may be needed. Do not delay seeking medical attention if the bumps are growing, painful, or accompanied by redness or discharge.
Hello Shikha, muscle twitches can be caused by various factors including electrolyte imbalances, stress, or anxiety. Your slightly low calcium level may contribute, but it's minimal.

If symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation including nerve conduction studies or MRI may be needed. Stay calm, follow up with your neurologist, and ensure adequate rest and hydration. You're taking the right steps—stay consistent with treatment.
Poor circulation in the legs can be caused by several factors, including peripheral artery disease (PAD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), varicose veins, or diabetes. Symptoms like tiredness and aching may also indicate venous insufficiency. It's important to evaluate for risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, or a sedentary lifestyle. Consider diagnostic tests like ankle-brachial index (ABI), Doppler ultrasound, or blood work. Consult a healthcare provider for proper assessment and management. Lifestyle changes, exercise, and possibly medications may be recommended based on the underlying cause.
Lower abdominal pain near the uterus after stopping birth control pills could be due to hormonal fluctuations, irregular menstrual cycle, or possible underlying conditions like endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Since you have a history of endometrial hyperplasia, it's important to monitor for any abnormal bleeding or persistent pain. Consider a pelvic ultrasound and follow-up with your gynecologist to rule out recurrence or other issues. If the pain is severe, worsening, or accompanied by fever, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, track symptoms and consult your doctor before your expected period.
Cholelithiasis (gallstones) may not always require surgery. If asymptomatic, observation may be sufficient. For symptomatic cases, options include medications like ursodeoxycholic acid to dissolve small stones, though this can take months and isn't always effective. Lifestyle changes—low-fat diet, weight management, regular exercise—can help prevent complications. However, if you experience frequent pain, infection, or complications, surgery (cholecystectomy) is often the most effective treatment. Discuss your concerns with your doctor to weigh risks and benefits of each option.
Your friend's symptoms could indicate a functional gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional dyspepsia, but other causes like gastritis, peptic ulcer, or even anxiety-related issues should be considered. The episodic nature of the pain suggests possible spastic or motility disorders. It's important to rule out structural issues with tests like an upper endoscopy or abdominal ultrasound. Over-the-counter antacids or proton pump inhibitors may help, but a proper diagnosis is crucial. Encourage her to follow up with a gastroenterologist for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan.
It is not uncommon to have some soft tissue flaps or irregularities after wisdom tooth removal, especially if sutures were placed.

Given your weight gain and symptoms, it is crucial to see a healthcare provider for evaluation, including ECG, chest X-ray, and blood tests. Anxiety and depression can exacerbate physical symptoms, but do not rule out underlying medical causes. Do not delay seeking professional medical care.
Swelling in the ankles, especially after prolonged sitting, could be due to fluid retention, which may be related to your diuretic use or other underlying conditions. While hydrochlorothiazide helps reduce fluid, it can sometimes cause paradoxical swelling if there's an imbalance or if the kidneys are not functioning optimally. Consider consulting your doctor for a physical exam, kidney function tests, and possibly an ultrasound of the legs to rule out deep vein thrombosis or other causes. Ensure you're not retaining too much fluid despite the medication. Stay hydrated and elevate your legs when possible.
Given your situation, option 1 (implant) or 2 (bridge) are more definitive solutions to prevent food lodgment. Option 3 (replacing the cap) may temporarily help but risks recurrence if the tooth structure is compromised. Leaving the root-canaled tooth without a cap (option 4) increases risk of decay and infection. An implant offers long-term stability and avoids altering adjacent teeth, while a bridge requires preparation of neighboring teeth. Consult with a dentist to evaluate bone density and overall oral health before deciding.
Probable diagnosis: Autoimmune hepatitis (given positive ANA, elevated LFTs, and no viral or obstructive causes). Management: Refer to a hepatologist for further evaluation, including liver biopsy. Monitor for complications, manage symptoms with anti-emetics, nutritional support, and consider immunosuppressive therapy if confirmed. Avoid hepatotoxic drugs and ensure adequate hydration. Follow-up with repeat labs and imaging as needed.
Hi Devi, hair loss after childbirth and while breastfeeding can be due to postpartum telogen effluvium, which is common. However, ongoing hair loss despite Thyronorm 50mg and multivitamins may indicate suboptimal thyroid control or other deficiencies. Ensure your TSH is within normal range. Also, check for iron, ferritin, vitamin D, and B12 levels. Consult your doctor for evaluation and possible adjustment of thyroid medication or additional supplements. It's not necessarily normal; investigate further.
Sharp chest pain can have various causes, including cardiac (e.g., angina, myocardial infarction), pulmonary (e.g., pleuritis, pneumothorax), musculoskeletal (e.g., costochondritis), or gastrointestinal (e.g., GERD). Given the potential for serious underlying conditions, especially if the pain is new, severe, or associated with shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness, it is critical to seek immediate medical evaluation. Diagnostic steps may include an ECG, chest X-ray, and blood tests. Do not delay care; consult a healthcare provider promptly for accurate assessment and management.
Kidney issues and bleeding gums can be related or separate. Kidney disease may cause fatigue, swelling, changes in urination, and sometimes bleeding due to impaired clotting. Bleeding gums may indicate gum disease, vitamin C deficiency, or systemic conditions like leukemia or coagulation disorders. It's important to evaluate both symptoms together. Recommend seeing a physician for blood tests (kidney function, CBC, coagulation profile) and a dental evaluation. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment.
As an alcohol-dependent individual, your partner requires careful management before dental procedures. Sedation or general anesthesia may be necessary due to her gag reflex and anxiety. However, alcohol use can increase bleeding risk, affect anesthesia metabolism, and complicate recovery. Dentists may proceed with precautions, including monitoring for alcohol-related complications. It is crucial she avoids alcohol for at least 24-48 hours pre-procedure if possible, but if not feasible, inform the dental team immediately. They may adjust sedation protocols and ensure close post-op monitoring. Encourage her to discuss her alcohol use openly with the dentist and consider consulting a specialist for safe sedation options.
If your husband's uric acid levels are normal but he continues to experience painful swelling in his big toe and foot, consider other causes such as pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease), arthritis (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), infection, or trauma. Evaluate for redness, warmth, or fever, which may suggest infection. Recommend a thorough clinical evaluation, including joint aspiration if needed, imaging (X-ray or MRI), and possibly inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP). Consult a rheumatologist for further assessment if symptoms persist.
Your mother's condition is serious, with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis, reduced heart function (ejection fraction of 25%), and pulmonary edema. Her prognosis depends on the severity of her heart failure, response to treatment, and underlying causes. Management includes diuretics, optimizing dialysis, and addressing any reversible factors. Prognosis varies, but with severe heart failure and comorbidities, survival rates can be low. Close monitoring, supportive care, and discussion with her healthcare team regarding advanced directives are essential. Early intervention improves outcomes, but long-term prognosis remains guarded.
Your mother's complex medical history includes gallbladder surgery, pancreatitis, diabetes, and recent symptoms like headaches, fainting, abdominal discharge, and gastrointestinal issues.

Your health and safety are paramount.
Persistent sensitivity after a root canal and crown could indicate incomplete treatment, a cracked tooth, or ongoing infection; continue the clindamycin as prescribed but consult your dentist or an endodontist for a re-evaluation, including a new X-ray to assess the tooth's condition. Do not delay care if symptoms worsen or if there's swelling.
Yes, you should consider emergency contraception (EC) due to the condom breakage and inconsistent birth control use. The risk of pregnancy is increased, especially since you just started your birth control and haven't taken it at the same time daily. EC is most effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex. Consult a healthcare provider or pharmacist for options like levonorgestrel or ulipristal acetate. Continue your regular birth control as prescribed and consider using backup protection until you are consistently taking it.
Your creatinine rise from 1.6 to 2.8 in 3 months despite improved weight and BP suggests possible renal function decline; consider evaluating for acute kidney injury, dehydration, infection, or medication changes. Monitor urine protein, electrolytes, and consider renal ultrasound. Continue kidney-friendly diet, stay hydrated, and consult your nephrologist for further workup including eGFR calculation and possible biopsy if indicated. Avoid NSAIDs and maintain BP control.
Your husband's symptoms of dark bloody stools and vomiting in the context of cirrhosis are concerning and could indicate upper gastrointestinal bleeding, such as from esophageal varices, which is a known complication of cirrhosis. The recent imaging tests are unlikely to cause this. Given the severity of his symptoms, he should seek immediate medical attention rather than waiting until Monday. Prompt evaluation is crucial to identify the source of bleeding and initiate appropriate treatment.
Bath salts can cause severe psychiatric symptoms including paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions due to their stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. There is no specific antidote, but medical evaluation is critical. Encourage immediate emergency care for monitoring, supportive treatment, and possible use of antipsychotics. Hydration and rest may help, but professional intervention is essential. Do not attempt to manage this at home.
Using Metasone Plus (which contains betamethasone) and Fluticasone BP topically without medical supervision can be harmful, as these are potent corticosteroids that may cause skin atrophy, acne, or pigmentation changes. For hyperpigmentation on cheeks, consider underlying causes like melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, or hormonal factors. Consult a dermatologist for proper evaluation, including a skin examination and possibly a biopsy. Avoid self-medicating with steroids; safer alternatives like hydroquinone, retinoids, or topical antioxidants may be recommended after diagnosis.
While garlic has antifungal properties, inserting it into the vagina is not a safe or effective treatment for yeast infections and can cause irritation or injury. It is not recommended to repeat this method. Instead, consider over-the-counter antifungal treatments like clotrimazole or miconazole, which are effective and widely available. If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. Avoid using home remedies that may pose risks.
George, for an angiogram and consultation with Dr. George Thayil at Lourdes Hospital in Dubai, you'll need a referral from your primary physician. The procedure typically takes 1-2 days, including pre-assessment, the test, and post-procedure observation. Your symptoms (chest pain, diabetes, hypertension, high LDL) warrant evaluation, even with a normal ECG. Contact Lourdes Hospital directly for Dr. Thayil's contact details and to schedule. Ensure your current medications, blood sugar, BP, and lipid levels are well-controlled before the procedure. Follow-up care is essential.
Your elevated resting heart rate (120-140 bpm) and episodes of vision loss in the right eye warrant urgent evaluation. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is possible, but other causes like arrhythmias, thyroid dysfunction, anemia, or autonomic instability should be ruled out. The vision loss could indicate retinal issues, optic neuropathy, or even a neurological cause. Given your weight, migraines, and history of depression, it's crucial to undergo a comprehensive workup including ECG, Holter monitor, thyroid function tests, complete blood count, and ophthalmologic assessment. Consult a cardiologist and neurologist for further evaluation. Do not delay seeking immediate medical attention for your symptoms.
A hard, painless lump on the gums, especially with a family history of oral cancer, warrants evaluation by a dentist or oral surgeon. While it could be benign (e.g., torus, cyst, or fibroma), the presence of a family history and the description of the lesion necessitate a thorough examination, possibly including imaging and biopsy. Avoiding tobacco and alcohol reduces risk but does not eliminate it. Schedule an appointment promptly for accurate diagnosis and peace of mind.
Your daughter's chest pressure, shakiness, and recent cold symptoms could indicate a variety of causes, including musculoskeletal strain, anxiety, or possibly a viral illness. However, given the chest discomfort, it's important to rule out more serious conditions like pericarditis, pneumonia, or even a cardiac issue, though rare in teens. Monitor for worsening symptoms, shortness of breath, fever, or dizziness. Encourage rest, hydration, and consider a clinical evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen, especially if she has a history of heart issues or risk factors. For now, observe closely and seek medical attention if concerns arise.
Wesley, your symptoms suggest a viral upper respiratory infection, which is common and usually self-limiting. However, your cough and reduced tolerance to smoking may indicate airway irritation or early bronchitis. Smoking exacerbates cough and delays recovery. Your throat should recover with time, but quitting smoking will significantly improve your respiratory health. If your cough persists beyond 2-3 weeks, worsens, or is accompanied by fever, shortness of breath, or blood in sputum, seek medical evaluation to rule out bacterial infection or other complications. Stay hydrated, avoid irritants, and consider nicotine replacement therapy if you're trying to quit smoking.
It is possible that ovulation has occurred, but pregnancy may take time to confirm. A 20mm follicle is mature and likely ruptured. Symptoms of pregnancy may not appear immediately. Consider taking a serum beta-hCG test 14 days post-ovulation for accurate results. If negative, consult your doctor for further evaluation, including hormone levels and partner's semen analysis. Continue tracking basal body temperature and consider timed intercourse. Patience is key, as conception can take several cycles. Maintain a healthy lifestyle and manage stress.
Your symptoms of sudden, intense abdominal pain, frequent small-volume stools, and the ultrasound findings of mild hepatomegaly with fatty liver (grade I) and borderline spleen suggest possible liver dysfunction or biliary issues. Consider evaluating for hepatitis, gallstones, or metabolic disorders. Recommend consulting a gastroenterologist for further assessment, including liver function tests, viral hepatitis screening, and possibly a CT scan or MRI. Maintain hydration, avoid alcohol, and follow a low-fat diet. Monitor for worsening symptoms or jaundice.
Your LFT shows elevated bilirubin (1.57 mg/dL), SGPT (123 U/L), and SGOT (84 U/L), suggesting liver dysfunction, likely due to alcohol use and dietary habits. As a 42-year-old with daily alcohol consumption (150 ml) and spicy non-vegetarian diet, you are at risk for alcoholic hepatitis or fatty liver. Recovery depends on abstinence from alcohol, adherence to a balanced diet, and weight management. With strict compliance, improvement may occur within 3-6 months, but full recovery varies. You must avoid alcohol and spicy foods long-term to prevent further damage. Consult your physician for a detailed plan and monitoring.
A hard, tender bump the size of a quarter after trauma is likely a hematoma or a subcutaneous cyst. If it's painful and firm, it may be a collection of blood under the skin (hematoma) or a sebaceous cyst. Monitor for increasing pain, redness, warmth, or fever, which could indicate infection. If it persists, grows, or causes concern, consult a healthcare provider for evaluation. No immediate concern unless symptoms worsen.
At 20 weeks, increased amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) and a slightly elevated GTT result suggestive of gestational diabetes can occur, but with proper management, most pregnancies proceed safely. Polyhydramnios may be associated with gestational diabetes, fetal anomalies, or other factors; the stomach bubble sonography will help assess for any underlying issues. Gestational diabetes, if managed through diet, exercise, and sometimes insulin, reduces risks to the baby, such as macrosomia or preterm birth. Regular monitoring, including glucose control and ultrasounds, is essential. Your healthcare team will guide you closely—stay positive, follow their recommendations, and attend all appointments for the best outcome.
A persistent cough lasting over a year, especially with phlegm and a history of mold exposure, raises concern for chronic bronchitis, asthma, or postnasal drip. Mold exposure can contribute to respiratory issues. Since your previous diagnosis was sinus drainage, consider evaluating for underlying conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recommend a chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests, and possibly a referral to a pulmonologist. Ensure you are not exposed to mold or other irritants. If symptoms persist, further investigation is warranted.
Your husband's symptoms of pain, burning, and discomfort in the area of his previous orchidectomy, along with urinary sensations, may suggest nerve-related issues such as post-orchidectomy neuropathy or referred pain. The burning sensation could indicate nerve irritation or damage. It is important to consult a urologist for a thorough evaluation, including neurological assessment and imaging if necessary. Prostate checks being normal do not rule out other causes. Consideration of nerve conduction studies or referral to a pain management specialist may be warranted. Ensure he avoids prolonged sitting and discuss symptoms in detail with a healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and management.
Cervical foraminal stenosis with osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease at C4-C5 to T1 can lead to progressive nerve compression. While corticosteroid injections may temporarily reduce inflammation, they do not halt bone growth. Non-surgical options include physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., NSAIDs), and possibly epidural steroid injections. However, if symptoms worsen or limb function declines, surgical decompression (e.g., foraminotomy or fusion) may be necessary to prevent permanent nerve damage. Consult a spine specialist for individualized evaluation and management plan.
Your symptoms of upper left abdominal discomfort, increased firmness, and worsening after eating could suggest gastrointestinal or splenic issues; given your PCOS history, consider gallbladder or pancreatic involvement. Avoid lying on your left side if it exacerbates discomfort. Evaluate for possible gastritis, peptic ulcer, or splenomegaly. Monitor for fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. Consult a physician for physical exam, abdominal ultrasound, and blood work (CBC, amylase/lipase, LFTs). Do not delay evaluation, as persistent symptoms warrant further investigation.
Your ultrasound findings are normal, showing a structurally healthy uterus, ovaries with physiologic follicles, and no abnormalities. A 1.2 cm hyperechoic endometrium suggests a secretory phase, which is appropriate for fertility. However, infertility after 7 years of regular unprotected intercourse warrants further evaluation, including hormonal assessments, tubal patency tests, and possibly semen analysis for your partner. While your ultrasound does not indicate structural issues, other factors may affect conception. Consult a reproductive specialist for a comprehensive infertility workup.
Mintop 5 (minoxidil 5%) is a topical treatment for hair loss, but it may take 3-6 months to show significant results. If you've only been using it for 1 month and notice no improvement or increased hair loss, continue as prescribed and monitor for 2-3 more months. Hair loss can sometimes worsen initially due to shedding. You may use almond oil or other natural oils like castor or jojoba oil, applying them 1-2 hours after minoxidil to avoid diluting its effect. Always consult your dermatologist if there's no improvement after 3-4 months.
A lump-like sensation at the base of the neck could be due to several causes, including an enlarged thyroid, lymph node, or even a cyst. Given your age, gender, and lack of swallowing difficulties or pain, it is less likely to be a serious issue, but evaluation is recommended. Consider seeing a healthcare provider for a physical exam and possibly an ultrasound of the neck. The shoulder blade discomfort may be unrelated, possibly muscular, but also worth mentioning during your visit. No immediate cause for alarm, but professional assessment is advised.
As a 56-year-old female with stress-induced anxiety and depression, your weight loss and symptoms are likely related to psychological stress rather than hormonal imbalances. While HGH (human growth hormone) may have some benefits in specific conditions, it is not indicated for anxiety or weight gain in this context. Low-dose HGH is not approved for non-medical use and can have serious side effects. Your primary focus should be on addressing the underlying stress through counseling, therapy, and possibly medication. Consult a psychiatrist for appropriate management of your mental health and discuss nutritional support with a dietitian to regain weight safely. Do not pursue HGH without medical supervision.
Your persistent left-sided low back pain with radiation to the hip, worsening in the morning and resolving by night, along with an elevated RA factor, raises concern for inflammatory or autoimmune conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis or reactive arthritis. Despite normal imaging, consider referral to a rheumatologist for further evaluation, including HLA-B27 testing and inflammatory markers. Persistent pain unresponsive to standard treatments warrants exclusion of rare causes like sacroiliitis or nerve entrapment. Continue monitoring for systemic symptoms and consider a multidisciplinary approach.
Swelling, pain, muscle stiffness, and numbness after bee/wasp stings may indicate a more severe reaction; consider possible allergic or localized infection. Continue icing, elevate the arm, and monitor for worsening symptoms. Over-the-counter antihistamines may help reduce swelling. If numbness persists, redness, warmth, or fever develops, seek immediate medical attention as this could signal an infection or systemic reaction. Avoid scratching the bites and keep the area clean. If symptoms do not improve within 24-48 hours, consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation.
Your 5-year-old daughter's symptoms—recurrent runny nose, sore eyes, dark under-eye circles, pallor, armpit soreness, and a history of elevated IgA and egg white allergy—raise concern for possible chronic allergic conditions, anemia, or systemic illness. Dark circles and pallor may indicate anemia or chronic inflammation. Armpit soreness could be related to lymphadenopathy or dermatitis. Given her declining general condition, prompt evaluation by a pediatrician is essential. Consider blood tests (CBC, iron studies, allergy panel, IgA levels) and referral to a pediatric allergist or immunologist for further assessment. Avoid known allergens and monitor for fever, weight loss, or other worsening symptoms.
Yes, it is advisable to proceed with the BERA (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry) hearing test. A bilirubin level of 26 mg/dL is significantly high and can increase the risk of kernicterus, which may lead to sensorineural hearing loss. Although not all cases result in hearing impairment, the recommendation is precautionary to ensure early detection and intervention if needed. Follow your doctor's advice to safeguard your baby's health.
Your son's symptoms of chest tightness, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, decreased saliva production, and lack of appetite raise concerns for a possible viral illness, esophageal spasm, or even a cardiac issue despite a normal chest X-ray. Given the persistence of symptoms and his discomfort in all positions, further evaluation is needed. Consider an ECG, blood tests, and possibly a CT scan or endoscopy if symptoms persist. Ensure he stays hydrated and monitor for worsening symptoms. Follow up with a pediatrician or specialist promptly.
If there was potential exposure to semen, emergency contraception (like Cycleonorm E and P) is appropriate. Since your partner took it for the first time and her last period was December 30, she should take the pill as directed. Monitor for side effects and a menstrual period within 1-2 weeks. If her period is delayed by more than a week, perform a pregnancy test. For future protection, consider regular contraception methods. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized guidance.
A painless, soft, fluctuating lump on the neck that is not growing and only painful with pressure could be a benign cyst, such as a sebaceous cyst or a lipoma. Since two MDs have evaluated it and deemed it non-concerning, it may indeed be a muscular issue or benign. However, if it changes in size, texture, or becomes painful, or if you develop other symptoms, further evaluation with imaging (e.g., ultrasound) or referral to a specialist may be warranted. Monitor for any changes and follow up if concerns persist.
Your symptoms of thick, hard, and shiny skin could indicate conditions such as scleroderma, lichen sclerosis, or localized scleroderma. These conditions involve abnormal collagen buildup or inflammation. It is important to consult a dermatologist for a proper evaluation, which may include a skin biopsy. Avoid self-diagnosis and seek professional medical advice to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment plan.
Tiny red dots with white circles on the legs, without itching or pain, could be petechiae, purpura, or possibly a reaction to medication. Given your history of breast cancer and current evaluation for uterine cancer, it's important to rule out metastatic disease or immune-related changes. The Percocet taken a week ago is unlikely to be directly responsible. However, consult your physician for a thorough evaluation, including skin examination and possible blood work to assess for coagulopathy or other systemic causes. Do not ignore these lesions, especially in the context of your medical history.
For a 5-month-old with mild symptoms, avoid over-the-counter medications like Coriminc drops or nasal drops without medical advice. A slight runny nose and poor sleep may indicate a viral infection. Ensure proper hydration, use a bulb syringe for nasal mucus, and maintain a comfortable environment. Do not use nasal decongestants in infants under 2 years. Consult a pediatrician for evaluation and appropriate management. Avoid self-medicating; seek professional guidance for safe treatment.
Your 3-year-old's symptoms—vomiting, watery stools, severe leg pain, and refusal to eat or drink—could indicate a serious condition such as gastroenteritis with dehydration, intussusception, or a systemic infection. The leg pain may suggest a viral illness (e.g., hand-foot-mouth disease) or an inflammatory process. Immediate medical evaluation is crucial to assess for dehydration, rule out intestinal obstruction, and initiate appropriate treatment. Encourage small sips of oral rehydration solution if tolerated; avoid solid foods. Seek urgent care if there's persistent vomiting, lethargy, or signs of dehydration (dry mouth, no tears, reduced urine output). Do not delay seeking professional medical attention.
Fluid overload means excess fluid accumulation in your body, often due to impaired heart function or kidney issues. Your aortic valve replacement and declining ejection fraction (from 18% to 62%) suggest possible heart failure. Lasic (furosemide) is a diuretic to reduce fluid, but if you're still retaining fluid, your condition may need reassessment. Monitor weight, limit sodium intake, and report increased swelling, shortness of breath, or rapid weight gain. Your cardiologist may adjust medications or investigate underlying causes like renal function or valve performance. Follow up promptly for further evaluation.
Your symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pressure, and elevated heart rate post-surgery could suggest pulmonary hypertension, especially given your history of sarcoidosis and lung surgery. However, other causes like arrhythmia, deconditioning, or residual lung disease should also be considered. Monitor for signs of right heart strain (e.g., peripheral edema, jugular venous distension). Consult your physician for echocardiogram, BNP/NT-proBNP, and possibly right heart catheterization if suspicion is high. Continue amiodarone as prescribed and follow up promptly.
The injection is likely a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) shot, which triggers ovulation. FERTAB-50 (clomiphene citrate) stimulates follicle development, and the hCG shot mimics the LH surge to release the egg. You were advised to avoid intercourse until day 12 to time intercourse precisely around ovulation, maximizing pregnancy chances. Follow your doctor’s instructions closely for optimal results.
Your mother's symptoms of persistent breathlessness, cough, and reduced urine output despite treatment suggest an underlying condition that requires further evaluation. The GP's prescription of doxycycline (for possible bacterial infection) and lactobacillus (for gut health) may not address the root cause. Possible considerations include respiratory infections, heart failure, or kidney issues. It is important to monitor for additional symptoms like chest pain, swelling, or fever. Further diagnostic steps such as chest X-ray, ECG, and renal function tests are recommended. Please follow up with your GP or a specialist for a thorough assessment.
Your symptoms of swollen, painful lymph nodes in the neck and chin, along with itchy pinkish rashes on the face and neck, could suggest an allergic reaction, viral infection, or possibly a skin condition like eczema or contact dermatitis. Given the involvement of lymph nodes, an infectious or immune-mediated process should be considered. It's important to evaluate for possible triggers such as new products, medications, or environmental exposures. Consider seeing a healthcare provider for a physical exam, possibly skin testing, and blood work to determine the underlying cause. Avoid scratching to prevent secondary infection.
Your symptoms—sudden dizziness, double vision, vertigo, nausea, and difficulty looking up—could indicate a vestibular disorder, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), inner ear disturbance, or even a central cause like a posterior circulation issue. Given your history of camping in Big Bend NP, consider possible exposure to tick-borne illnesses (e.g., Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever) or other environmental factors. Monitor for fever, rash, or neurological deficits. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek urgent medical evaluation, including neurologic and ENT assessment. Avoid self-diagnosis; professional evaluation is crucial.
Based on your description, there may be a hereditary psychiatric condition in the family. Your cousin's symptoms suggest possible anxiety or early signs of a psychotic disorder. Paroxetine 25 mg daily is appropriate for anxiety, but tapering to 12.5 mg after 6 months should be done gradually under medical supervision. A low-dose benzodiazepine like clonazepam 0.5 mg at night may help with sleep and anxiety, but use should be limited to avoid dependency. Side effects of paroxetine include drowsiness, nausea, and sexual dysfunction. It is crucial to consult a psychiatrist for proper diagnosis and treatment plan, as self-medication can be risky. Avoid abrupt changes in medication without professional guidance.
It is concerning that you are experiencing localized bruising and radiating pain after a forceful manipulation. While some people experience temporary discomfort after spinal adjustments, the symptoms you describe—bruising, radiating pain, and increased discomfort with movement—warrant evaluation for possible soft tissue injury, muscle strain, or even a vertebral fracture. Given your active lifestyle, it is important to rule out any structural damage. I recommend seeking immediate medical attention for a physical examination and imaging (e.g., X-ray or MRI) if needed. Avoid strenuous activity until evaluated.
A rash on the inner thighs, sides, arms, and buttocks that worsens with heat and has occurred in close contacts could be a viral exanthem, contact dermatitis, or fungal infection. Since it's not painful except with heat, consider heat rash (miliaria) or a mild allergic reaction. However, the clustering in close contacts suggests a possible contagious cause like tinea or a viral illness. Avoid irritants, keep the area cool and dry, and monitor for itching, scaling, or spreading. If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a healthcare provider for evaluation, possibly including a skin scraping or culture to identify the cause.
A fall causing rib pain without visible bruising could indicate a rib contusion, fracture, or injury to underlying structures. At 84, you're at higher risk for complications. While lung bruise (pulmonary contusion) is possible, it's less likely without other symptoms like shortness of breath or coughing up blood. However, given your age and the persistent deep pain, an X-ray is recommended to rule out fractures or other injuries. Consult your physician promptly for evaluation and imaging if pain persists.
Brahmala Ghruta is an Ayurvedic preparation, but there is limited scientific evidence supporting its use for improving memory or concentration in adolescents. For a 14-year-old with no medical history, it is not advisable to use unproven remedies without medical supervision. Dosage and safety are not well established in this age group. Stress during exams can be managed through healthy lifestyle habits, adequate sleep, and mindfulness techniques. Consult a pediatrician before starting any supplement. Avoid self-medication to prevent potential side effects.
Polio can cause permanent muscle atrophy and limb asymmetry. While surgery cannot cure polio, procedures like tendon transfers, osteotomies, or orthopedic surgeries may improve function and appearance. Consult a neurologist and orthopedic surgeon for evaluation. Institutions like AIIMS, Apollo Hospitals, or Medanta in India have expertise in such cases. Psychological support is also crucial for self-esteem. Surgery outcomes depend on individual assessment; seek a specialist for personalized options.
Your symptoms suggest a possible urinary tract infection or kidney stones, with persistent pain despite treatment. Ciprofloxacin may not be effective if the infection is resistant or if there's an underlying issue. Continue hydrating but avoid excessive urination as it can irritate. Voren (Voveran) can help with pain but should be used cautiously. You need to return to your doctor for further evaluation, including a urine culture, CT scan, or MRI to rule out complications like pyelonephritis or obstructive urolithiasis. Do not delay seeking urgent care if fever or worsening pain occurs.
Your newborn's symptoms suggest possible infantile colic or gastrointestinal discomfort, possibly due to gas, overfeeding, or lactose intolerance. The bloated, hard tummy, gurgling noises, and frequent regurgitation are concerning. Ensure proper latching during feeding to prevent excess air intake. Try gentle tummy massages, bicycle leg movements, and upright positioning after feeds. If symptoms persist, consult a pediatrician to rule out gastroesophageal reflux, cow's milk protein allergy, or other issues. Monitor for weight gain and hydration; seek urgent care if she shows signs of dehydration or distress.
Based on your chest X-ray findings, "hilar glands increased" and "prominent broncho-vascular markings" may suggest old or chronic lung changes, possibly from prior infections like tuberculosis, pneumonia, or other inflammatory processes. Since your current symptoms are mild and recent X-ray was negative for active TB, it's less likely you have active tuberculosis now. However, follow-up with a pulmonologist is advisable for further evaluation, including possible CT scan or sputum tests if symptoms persist. Continue prescribed medications as directed, maintain good hygiene, and monitor for worsening symptoms. No specific treatment is needed unless active disease is confirmed.
Your symptoms—throbbing pain, shooting pain up your hand, and clear watery drainage—could indicate an infection. While initial care was appropriate, the worsening pain and drainage suggest possible infection. Monitor for redness, swelling, fever, or pus. Contact your doctor promptly for evaluation; they may need to assess the wound, possibly prescribe antibiotics, or adjust treatment. Avoid using the hand excessively and keep the area clean and dry until seen.
Your daughter's height is within the normal range, but her recent behavioral changes—restlessness, involuntary movements, facial expressions, clumsiness, and difficulty sitting still—could indicate a neurological or developmental condition such as tics, ADHD, or possibly a movement disorder. These symptoms are not typical for her age and warrant evaluation by a pediatrician or neurologist. A thorough assessment, including a physical exam and possibly imaging or blood tests, may be needed to rule out underlying causes. Early intervention can significantly improve outcomes. Please consult a specialist promptly.
Your symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of agoraphobia with panic attacks, which can lead to severe avoidance of places or situations that might cause panic, helplessness, or embarrassment. It is crucial to consult a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation and potential treatment with therapy (such as CBT) and/or medication. Additionally, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support, as your condition is impacting your daily life significantly. You are not alone, and effective treatments are available. Please seek help immediately.
Your symptoms suggest a possible genital infection or irritation, possibly related to the urinary tract infection (UTI) or a separate condition like a fungal infection, contact dermatitis, or herpes. The redness, dryness, and peeling skin may indicate an allergic reaction, yeast infection, or viral cause. Continue your antibiotic as prescribed, but consult a healthcare provider for evaluation, especially if symptoms persist. Avoid irritants, keep the area clean and dry, and consider over-the-counter antifungal creams (e.g., clotrimazole) if a yeast infection is suspected. If pain or discomfort worsens, seek medical attention promptly.
At 39 weeks pregnant, experiencing chills, shaking, and reduced fetal movement is concerning. Chills could indicate an infection, which may also affect the baby's movements. Reduced fetal movement can signal potential distress. You should contact your healthcare provider immediately for evaluation, including a non-stress test and possibly an ultrasound to assess the baby's well-being. Stay hydrated, monitor movements closely, and seek urgent care if symptoms persist or worsen. Do not delay medical attention.
Your symptoms, including bright red blood from the anus, polyps found during endoscopy, and a history of diabetes, hypertension, anemia, and arterial hardening, raise concerns for colorectal cancer. Polyps can become cancerous, so further evaluation with colonoscopy and biopsy is essential. Given your age and risk factors, regular screening is crucial. Consult a gastroenterologist for definitive diagnosis and management. Addressing anemia and controlling diabetes and hypertension are also important. Do not delay follow-up.
Swelling in one foot after long travel could indicate deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or worsening of venous insufficiency, especially with a history of heart surgery and diuretic use. Elevate the foot, avoid prolonged sitting, and consider compression stockings. Monitor for redness, warmth, or pain. If swelling recurs or worsens, consult your physician for possible ultrasound evaluation to rule out DVT. Ensure adequate hydration and discuss with your doctor about adjusting diuretic dosage if needed. Avoid prolonged immobility during travel.
